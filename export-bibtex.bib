     abstract = "{Galaxy sizes and their evolution over cosmic time have been studied for
        decades and serve as key tests of galaxy formation models.
        However, at z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 1 these studies have been
        limited by a lack of deep, high-resolution rest-frame infrared
        imaging that accurately traces stellar mass distributions. Here,
        we leverage the new capabilities of the James Webb Space
        Telescope (JWST) to measure the 4.4 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m sizes of
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1000 galaxies with
        $\mathrm{log}{M}_{* }/{M}_{\odot }\geqslant 9$ and 1.0
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} z {\ensuremath{\leq}} 2.5 from public CEERS
        imaging in the Extended Groth Strip deep field. We compare the
        sizes of galaxies measured from NIRCam imaging at 4.4
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m ({\ensuremath{\lambda}} $_{rest}$
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1.6 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) with
        sizes measured at 1.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m
        ({\ensuremath{\lambda}} $_{rest}$
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 5500 {\r{A}}). We find that, on
        average, galaxy half-light radii are
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde9\% smaller at 4.4
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m than 1.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m in this sample.
        This size difference is markedly stronger at higher stellar
        masses and redder rest-frame V - J colors: galaxies with M
        $_{*}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde {}10$^{11}$ M
        $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ have 4.4 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m sizes
        that are \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30\% smaller than their
        1.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m sizes. Our results indicate that galaxy
        mass profiles are significantly more compact than their rest-
        frame optical light profiles at cosmic noon, and demonstrate
        that spatial variations in age and attenuation are important,
        particularly for massive galaxies. The trend we find here
        impacts our understanding of the size growth and evolution of
        galaxies, and suggests that previous studies based on rest-frame
        optical light may not have captured the mass-weighted structural
        evolution of galaxies. This paper represents a first step toward
        a new understanding of the morphologies of early massive
        galaxies enabled by JWST's infrared window into the distant
        universe.}",

     abstract = "{Post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) have recently and rapidly quenched their
        star-formation, thus they are an important way to understand how
        galaxies transition from star-forming late-types to quiescent
        early-types. The recent discovery of large cold gas reservoirs
        in PSBs calls into question the theory that galaxies must lose
        their gas to become quiescent. Optical Integral Field
        Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys have revealed two classes of PSBs:
        central PSBs with central quenching regions and ring PSBs with
        quenching in their outskirts. We analyze a sample of 13 nearby
        (z < 0.1) PSBs with spatially resolved optical IFS data from the
        Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)
        survey and matched resolution Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter
        Array (ALMA) observations of $^{12}$CO(1-0). Disturbed stellar
        kinematics in 7/13 of our PSBs and centrally concentrated
        molecular gas is consistent with a recent merger for most of our
        sample. In galaxies without merger evidence, alternate processes
        may funnel gas inwards and suppress star-formation, which may
        include outflows, stellar bars, and minor mergers or
        interactions. The star-formation efficiencies of the post-
        starburst regions in nearly half our galaxies are suppressed
        while the gas fractions are consistent with star-forming
        galaxies. AGN feedback may drive this stabilization, and we
        observe AGN-consistent emission in the centers of 5/13 galaxies.
        Finally, our central and ring PSBs have similar properties
        except the ionized and molecular gas in central PSBs is more
        disturbed. Overall, the molecular gas in our PSBs tends to be
        compact and highly disturbed, resulting in concentrated gas
        reservoirs unable to form stars efficiently.}",

        of six new dusty galaxies at 3.5 < z < 4.2 by solidly detecting
        [CI](1-0) and CO transitions. The sample was selected from the
        COSMOS and GOODS-North super-deblended catalogs with far-
        infrared (FIR) photometric redshifts z$_{phot}$ > 6 based on
        template IR spectral energy distribution (SED) from known
        submillimeter galaxies at z = 4-6. Dust SED analyses explain the
        z$_{phot}$ overestimate from seemingly cold dust temperatures
        (T$_{d}$) and steep Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) slopes, providing
        additional examples of cold dusty galaxies impacted by the
        cosmic microwave background (CMB). We therefore studied the
        general properties of the enlarged sample of 10 ``cold'' dusty
        galaxies over 3.5 < z < 6. We conclude that these galaxies are
        deceivingly cold at the surface but are actually warm in their
        starbursting cores. Several lines of evidence support this
        scenario: (1) The high infrared surface density
        {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{IR}$ and cold T$_{d}$ from optically
        thin models appear to violate the Stefan-Boltzmann law; (2) the
        gas masses derived from optically thin dust masses are
        inconsistent with estimates from dynamics and CI luminosities;
        (3) the implied high star formation efficiencies would conflict
        with cold T$_{d}$; and (4) high FIR optical depth is implied
        even using the lower, optically thick dust masses. This work
        confirms the existence of a substantial population of
        deceivingly cold, compact dusty starburst galaxies at z
        {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 4, together with the severe impact of the
        CMB on their RJ observables, paving the way for the diagnostics
        of optically thick dust in the early Universe. Conventional gas
        mass estimates based on RJ dust continuum luminosities
        implicitly assume an optically thin case, which leads to
        overestimation of gas masses by a factor of 2-3 on average in
        compact dusty star-forming galaxies.}",

     abstract = "{Recent studies have shown that galaxies at cosmic noon are redder in the
        center and bluer in the outskirts, mirroring results in the
        local universe. These color gradients could be caused by either
        gradients in the stellar age or dust opacity; however,
        distinguishing between these two causes is impossible with rest-
        frame optical photometry alone. Here we investigate the
        underlying causes of the gradients from spatially-resolved rest-
        frame $U-V$ vs. $V-J$ color-color diagrams, measured from early
        observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. We use $1\,
        \mu m - 4\, \mu m$ NIRCam photometry from the CEERS survey of a
        sample of 54 galaxies with $M_* / M_\odot>10$ at redshifts
        $1.7<z<2.3$ selected from the 3D-HST catalog. We model the light
        profiles in the F115W, F200W and F356W NIRCam bands using
        \textbackslashtexttt\{imcascade\}, a Bayesian implementation of
        the Multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) technique which flexibly
        represents galaxy profiles using a series of Gaussians. We
        construct resolved rest-frame $U-V$ and $V-J$ color profiles.
        The majority of star-forming galaxies have negative gradients
        (i.e. redder in the center, bluer in the outskirts) in both
        $U-V$ and $V-J$ colors consistent with radially decreasing dust
        attenuation. A smaller population (roughly 15\textbackslash\%)
        of star-forming galaxies have positive $U-V$ but negative $V-J$
        gradients implying centrally concentrated star-formation. For
        quiescent galaxies we find a diversity of UVJ color profiles,
        with roughly one-third showing star-formation in their center.

     abstract = "{The various Euclid imaging surveys will become a reference for studies
        of galaxy morphology by delivering imaging over an unprecedented
        area of 15 000 square degrees with high spatial resolution. In
        order to understand the capabilities of measuring morphologies
        from Euclid-detected galaxies and to help implement measurements
        in the pipeline, we have conducted the Euclid Morphology
        Challenge, which we present in two papers. While the companion
        paper by Merlin et al. focuses on the analysis of photometry,
        this paper assesses the accuracy of the parametric galaxy
        morphology measurements in imaging predicted from within the
        Euclid Wide Survey. We evaluate the performance of five state-
        of-the-art surface-brightness-fitting codes DeepLeGATo,
        Galapagos-2, Morfometryka, Profit and SourceXtractor++ on a
        sample of about 1.5 million simulated galaxies resembling
        reduced observations with the Euclid VIS and NIR instruments.
        The simulations include analytic S{\'e}rsic profiles with one
        and two components, as well as more realistic galaxies generated
        with neural networks. We find that, despite some code-specific
        differences, all methods tend to achieve reliable structural
        measurements (10\% scatter on ideal S{\'e}rsic simulations) down
        to an apparent magnitude of about 23 in one component and 21 in
        two components, which correspond to a signal-to-noise ratio of
        approximately 1 and 5 respectively. We also show that when
        tested on non-analytic profiles, the results are typically
        degraded by a factor of 3, driven by systematics. We conclude
        that the Euclid official Data Releases will deliver robust
        structural parameters for at least 400 million galaxies in the
        Euclid Wide Survey by the end of the mission. We find that a key
        factor for explaining the different behaviour of the codes at
        the faint end is the set of adopted priors for the various
        structural parameters.}",

     abstract = "{We present a novel method for estimating galaxy physical properties from
        spectral energy distributions (SEDs) as an alternative to
        template fitting techniques and based on self-organizing maps
        (SOMs) to learn the high-dimensional manifold of a photometric
        galaxy catalog. The method has previously been tested with
        hydrodynamical simulations in Davidzon et al. (2019, MNRAS, 489,
        4817), however, here it is applied to real data for the first
        time. It is crucial for its implementation to build the SOM with
        a high-quality panchromatic data set, thus we selected
        ``COSMOS2020'' galaxy catalog for this purpose. After the
        training and calibration steps with COSMOS2020, other galaxies
        can be processed through SOMs to obtain an estimate of their
        stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). Both quantities
        resulted in a good agreement with independent measurements
        derived from more extended photometric baseline and, in
        addition, their combination (i.e., the SFR vs. stellar mass
        diagram) shows a main sequence of star-forming galaxies that is
        consistent with the findings of previous studies. We discuss the
        advantages of this method compared to traditional SED fitting,
        highlighting the impact of replacing the usual synthetic
        templates with a collection of empirical SEDs built by the SOM
        in a ``data-driven'' way. Such an approach also allows, even for
        extremely large data sets, for an efficient visual inspection to
        identify photometric errors or peculiar galaxy types. While also
        considering the computational speed of this new estimator, we
        argue that it will play a valuable role in the analysis of
        oncoming large-area surveys such as Euclid of the Legacy Survey
        of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Telescope.}",

        were also detected at 1.2 mm with Atacama Large Millimeter Array

     abstract = "{We used the COSMOS2020 catalog to measure the stellar-to-halo mass
        relation (SHMR) divided by central and satellite galaxies from z
        = 0.2 to z = 5.5. Starting from accurate photometric redshifts,
        we measured the near-infrared selected two-point angular
        correlation and stellar mass functions in ten redshift bins. We
        used a phenomenological model that parametrizes the stellar-to-
        halo mass relation for central galaxies and the number of
        galaxies inside each halo to describe our observations. This
        model qualitatively reproduces our measurements and their
        dependence on the stellar mass threshold. Surprisingly, the mean
        halo occupation distribution only shows a mild evolution with
        redshift suggesting that galaxies occupy halos similarly
        throughout cosmic time. At each redshift, we measured the ratio
        of stellar mass to halo mass, M$_{*}$/M$_{h}$, which shows the
        characteristic strong dependence of halo mass with a peak at
        M$_{h}$$^{peak}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2 {\texttimes} {}10$^{12}$
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. For the first time, using a joint
        modeling of clustering and abundances, we measured the evolution
        of M$_{h}$$^{peak}$ from z = 0.2 to z = 5.5. M$_{h}$$^{peak}$
        increases gradually with redshift from log
        M$_{h}$$^{peak}$/M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}}
        12.1 at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.3 to log
        M$_{h}$$^{peak}$/M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}}
        12.3 at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2, and up to log
        M$_{h}$$^{peak}$/M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}}
        12.9 at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 5. Similarly, the stellar mass
        peak M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$$^{peak}$ increases with redshift
        from log
        M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$$^{peak}$/M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10.5 at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.3 to log
        M$_{{\ensuremath{*}}}$$^{peak}$/M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10.9 at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 3. The SHMR
        ratio at the peak halo mass remains almost constant with
        redshift. These results are in accordance with the scenario in
        which the peak of star-formation efficiency moves toward more
        massive halos at higher redshifts. We also measured the fraction
        of satellites as a function of stellar mass and redshift. For
        all stellar mass thresholds, the satellite fraction decreases at
        higher redshifts. At a given redshift, there is a higher
        fraction of low-mass satellites and this fraction reaches a
        plateau at {\ensuremath{\sim}}25\% at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 1.
        The satellite contribution to the total stellar mass budget in
        halos becomes more important than that of the central at halo
        masses of about M$_{h}$ > {}10$^{13}$ M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$
        and always stays below the peak, indicating that quenching
        mechanisms are present in massive halos that keep the star-
        formation efficiency low. Finally, we compared our results with
        three hydrodynamical simulations: HORIZON-AGN, TNG100 of the
        ILLUSTRISTNG project, and EAGLE. We find that the most
        significant discrepancy is at the high-mass end, where the
        simulations generally show that satellites have a higher
        contribution to the total stellar mass budget than the
        observations. This, together with the finding that the fraction
        of satellites is higher in the simulations, indicates that the
        feedback mechanisms acting in both group- and cluster-scale
        halos appear to be less efficient in quenching the mass assembly
        of satellites - and that quenching occurs much later in the
        simulations.}",

     abstract = "{$JWST$'s first glimpse of the $z>10$ Universe has yielded a surprising
        abundance of luminous galaxy candidates. Here we present the
        most extreme of these systems: CEERS-1749. Based on $0.6-5\mu$m
        photometry, this strikingly luminous ($\approx$26 mag) galaxy
        appears to lie at $z\approx17$. This would make it an
        $M_{\rm{UV}}\approx-22$,
        $M_{\rm{\star}}\approx5\times10^{9}M_{\rm{\odot}}$ system that
        formed a mere $\sim220$ Myrs after the Big Bang. The implied
        number density of this galaxy and its analogues challenges
        virtually every early galaxy evolution model that assumes
        $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. However, there is strong environmental
        evidence supporting a secondary redshift solution of
        $z\approx5$: all three of the galaxy's nearest neighbors at
        $<2.5$'' have photometric redshifts of $z\approx5$. Further, we
        show that CEERS-1749 may lie in a $z\approx5$ protocluster that
        is $rsim5\times$ overdense compared to the field. Intense line
        emission at $z\approx5$ from a quiescent galaxy harboring
        ionized gas, or from a dusty starburst, may provide satisfactory
        explanations for CEERS-1749's photometry. The emission lines at
        $z\approx5$ conspire to boost the $>2\mu$m photometry, producing
        an apparent blue slope as well as a strong break in the SED.
        Such a perfectly disguised contaminant is possible only in a
        narrow redshift window ($\Delta z\lesssim0.1$), implying that
        the permitted volume for such interlopers may not be a major
        concern for $z>10$ searches, particularly when medium-bands are
        deployed. If CEERS-1749 is confirmed to lie at $z\approx5$, it
        will be the highest-redshift quiescent galaxy, or one of the
        lowest mass dusty galaxies of the early Universe detected to-
        date. Both redshift solutions of this intriguing galaxy hold the
        potential to challenge existing models of early galaxy
        evolution, making spectroscopic follow-up of this source
        critical.}",

     abstract = "{We present a new method based on information theory to find the optimal
        number of bands required to measure the physical properties of
        galaxies with a desired accuracy. As a proof of concept, using
        the recently updated COSMOS catalog (COSMOS2020), we identify
        the most relevant wavebands for measuring the physical
        properties of galaxies in a Hawaii Two-0 (H20)- and UVISTA-like
        survey for a sample of $i<25$ AB mag galaxies. We find that with
        available $i$-band fluxes, $r$, $u$, IRAC/$ch2$ and $z$ bands
        provide most of the information regarding the redshift with
        importance decreasing from $r$-band to $z$-band. We also find
        that for the same sample, IRAC/$ch2$, $Y$, $r$ and $u$ bands are
        the most relevant bands in stellar mass measurements with
        decreasing order of importance. Investigating the inter-
        correlation between the bands, we train a model to predict
        UVISTA observations in near-IR from H20-like observations. We
        find that magnitudes in $YJH$ bands can be simulated/predicted
        with an accuracy of $1\sigma$ mag scatter $\lesssim 0.2$ for
        galaxies brighter than 24 AB mag in near-IR bands. One should
        note that these conclusions depend on the selection criteria of
        the sample. For any new sample of galaxies with a different
        selection, these results should be remeasured. Our results
        suggest that in the presence of a limited number of bands, a
        machine learning model trained over the population of observed
        galaxies with extensive spectral coverage outperforms template-
        fitting. Such a machine learning model maximally comprises the
        information acquired over available extensive surveys and breaks
        degeneracies in the parameter space of template-fitting
        inevitable in the presence of a few bands.}",

     abstract = "{With just a month of data, JWST is already transforming our view of the
        Universe, revealing and resolving starlight in unprecedented
        populations of galaxies. Although ``HST-dark'' galaxies have
        previously been detected at long wavelengths, these observations
        generally suffer from a lack of spatial resolution which limits
        our ability to characterize their sizes and morphologies. Here
        we report on a first view of starlight from a subset of the HST-
        dark population that are bright with JWST/NIRCam
        (4.4$\mu$m<24.5mag) and very faint or even invisible with HST
        ($<$1.6$\mu$m). In this Letter we focus on a dramatic and
        unanticipated population of physically extended galaxies
        ($rsim$0.17''). These 12 galaxies have photometric redshifts
        $2<z<6$, high stellar masses $M_{\star}rsim 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$,
        and significant dust-attenuated star formation. Surprisingly,
        the galaxies have elongated projected axis ratios at 4.4$\mu$m,
        suggesting that the population is disk-dominated or prolate.
        Most of the galaxies appear red at all radii, suggesting
        significant dust attenuation throughout. We refer to these red,
        disky, HST-dark galaxies as Ultra-red Flattened Objects (UFOs).
        With $r_e$(F444W)$\sim1-2$\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildekpc,
        the galaxies are similar in size to compact massive galaxies at
        $z\sim2$ and the cores of massive galaxies and S0s at $z\sim0$.
        The stellar masses, sizes, and morphologies of the sample
        suggest that some could be progenitors of lenticular or fast-
        rotating galaxies in the local Universe. The existence of this
        population suggests that our previous censuses of the universe
        may have missed massive, dusty edge-on disks, in addition to
        dust-obscured starbursts.}",

        significant insight into the structure and mass content of
        galaxy clusters, yet IFU-based cluster studies focus almost
        exclusively on the central Einstein-radius region. Covering over
        14 arcmin$^{2}$, the new MUSE mosaic extends significantly
        beyond the A370 Einstein radius, providing, for the first time,
        a detailed look at the cluster outskirts. Combining these data
        with wide-field, multi-band Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging
        from the BUFFALO project, we analyse the distribution of objects
        within the cluster and along the line of sight. Identifying 416
        cluster galaxies, we use kinematics to trace the radial mass
        profile of the halo, providing a mass estimate independent from
        the lens model. We also measure radially averaged properties of
        the cluster members, tracking their evolution as a function of
        infall. Thanks to the high spatial resolution of our data, we
        identify six cluster members acting as galaxy-galaxy lenses,
        which constrain localized mass distributions beyond the Einstein
        radius. Finally, taking advantage of MUSE's 3D capabilities, we
        detect and analyse multiple spatially extended overdensities
        outside of the cluster that influence lensing-derived halo mass
        estimates. We stress that much of this work is only possible
        thanks to the robust, extended IFU coverage, highlighting its
        importance even in less optically dense cluster regions.
        Overall, this work showcases the power of combining HST + MUSE,

        with $JWST$/NIRCam photometry spanning $\approx1-5\mu$m and
        covering 49 arcmin$^{2}$ from the public $JWST$ Early Release
        Science programs (CEERS and GLASS). Our most secure candidates
        are two $M_{\rm{UV}}\approx-21$ systems: GLASS-z13 and
        GLASS-z11. These galaxies display abrupt $rsim2.5$ mag breaks in
        their spectral energy distributions, consistent with complete
        absorption of flux bluewards of Lyman-$\alpha$ that is
        redshifted to $z\approx13$ and $z\approx11$. Lower redshift
        interlopers such as dusty quiescent galaxies with strong Balmer
        breaks would be comfortably detected at $>5\sigma$ in multiple

        that these galaxies have already built up $\sim 10^9$ solar
        masses in stars over the $\lesssim300-400$ Myrs after the Big

        galaxy of $r_{\rm{50}}\approx0.7$ kpc. These sources, if
        confirmed, join GNz11 in defying number density forecasts for
        luminous galaxies based on Schechter UV luminosity functions,
        which require a survey area $>10\times$ larger than we have
        studied here to find such luminous sources at such high

        or no evolution in the bright end of the UV luminosity function
        into the cosmic dawn epoch, with implications for just how early
        these galaxies began forming. This, in turn, suggests that

        galaxies to much earlier epochs than might have been

        revealed a population of likely massive galaxies at $z>3$ that
        was too faint to be detected in HST rest-frame ultraviolet
        imaging. However, due to the very limited photometry for
        individual galaxies, the true nature of these so-called HST-dark
        galaxies has remained elusive. Here, we present the first sample
        of such galaxies observed with very deep, high-resolution NIRCam
        imaging from the Early Release Science Program CEERS. 33 HST-
        dark sources are selected based on their red colours across 1.6
        $\mu$m to 4.4 $\mu$m. Their physical properties are derived from
        12-band multi-wavelength photometry, including ancillary HST
        imaging. We find that these galaxies are generally heavily dust-
        obscured ($A_{V}\sim2$ mag), massive ($\log (M/M_{\odot})
        \sim10$), star-forming sources at $z\sim2-8$ with an observed

        an important fraction of massive galaxies may have been missing

        galaxies in three Deep Fields, which together will cover a
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde40 deg2 area. However, the
        limited number of Euclid bands and availability of ancillary
        data could make the identification of z>6 galaxies challenging.
        In this work, we assess the degree of contamination by
        intermediate-redshift galaxies (z=1-5.8) expected for z>6
        galaxies within the Euclid Deep Survey. This study is based on
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde176,000 real galaxies at z=1-8
        in a \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.7 deg2 area selected from
        the UltraVISTA ultra-deep survey, and
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde96,000 mock galaxies with
        25.3$\leq$H<27.0, which altogether cover the range of magnitudes
        to be probed in the Euclid Deep Survey. We simulate Euclid and
        ancillary photometry from the fiducial, 28-band photometry, and
        fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to various combinations
        of these simulated data. Our study demonstrates that identifying
        z>6 with Euclid data alone will be very effective, with a z>6
        recovery of 91(88)\% for bright (faint) galaxies. For the
        UltraVISTA-like bright sample, the percentage of z=1-5.8
        contaminants amongst apparent z>6 galaxies as observed with
        Euclid alone is 18\%, which is reduced to 4(13)\% by including
        ultra-deep Rubin (Spitzer) photometry. Conversely, for the faint
        mock sample, the contamination fraction with Euclid alone is
        considerably higher at 39\%, and minimized to 7\% when including
        ultra-deep Rubin data. For UltraVISTA-like bright galaxies, we
        find that Euclid (I-Y)>2.8 and (Y-J)<1.4 colour criteria can
        separate contaminants from true z>6 galaxies, although these are
        applicable to only 54\% of the contaminants, as many have
        unconstrained (I-Y) colours. In the most optimistic scenario,
        these cuts reduce the contamination fraction to 1\% whilst
        preserving 81\% of the fiducial z>6 sample. For the faint mock
        sample, colour cuts are infeasible.}",

        the COSMOS field, after accounting for spatial varying point-
        spread functions and astrometric differences between the two
        data sets. We identify twelve low-luminosity (M $_{ UV }$
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde -21 mag) z > 6 quasar
        candidates through (i) their red color measured between
        ACS/F814W and HSC/i band and (ii) their compactness in the
        space-based data. Nondetections of our candidates in Hubble DASH
        data argues against contamination from late-type stars. Our
        constraints on the faint end of the quasar luminosity function
        at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 6.4 suggest a negligibly
        small contribution to reionization compared to the star-forming
        galaxy population. The confirmation of our candidates and the
        evolution of number density with redshift could provide better
        insights into how supermassive galaxies grew in the first
        billion years of cosmic time.}",

        observations with all relevant IRAC archival data of these
        fields in order to produce the deepest possible mosaics of these
        regions. In total, these observations represent nearly 11 \% of
        the total Spitzer Space Telescope mission time. The resulting
        mosaics cover a total of approximately 71.5 deg$^{2}$ in the 3.6
        and 4.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m bands, and approximately 21.8
        deg$^{2}$ in the 5.8 and 8 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m bands. They reach
        at least 24 AB magnitude (measured to 5{\ensuremath{\sigma}}, in
        a 2″.5 aperture) in the 3.6 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m band and up to
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}5 mag deeper in the deepest regions. The
        astrometry is tied to the Gaia astrometric reference system, and
        the typical astrometric uncertainty for sources with 16 < [3.6]<
        19 is {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}0″.15. The photometric calibration
        is in excellent agreement with previous WISE measurements. We
        extracted source number counts from the 3.6 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m
        band mosaics, and they are in excellent agreement with previous
        measurements. Given that the Spitzer Space Telescope has now
        been decommissioned, these mosaics are likely to be the
        definitive reduction of these IRAC data. This survey therefore
        represents an essential first step in assembling multi-
        wavelength data on the Euclid deep fields, which are set to
        become some of the premier fields for extragalactic astronomy in

        extragalactic astronomy. Since the last public catalog in 2015,
        a wealth of new imaging and spectroscopic data have been
        collected in the COSMOS field. This paper describes the
        collection, processing, and analysis of these new imaging data
        to produce a new reference photometric redshift catalog. Source
        detection and multiwavelength photometry are performed for 1.7
        million sources across the 2 deg$^{2}$ of the COSMOS field,
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde966,000 of which are measured
        with all available broadband data using both traditional
        aperture photometric methods and a new profile-fitting
        photometric extraction tool, THE FARMER, which we have
        developed. A detailed comparison of the two resulting
        photometric catalogs is presented. Photometric redshifts are
        computed for all sources in each catalog utilizing two
        independent photometric redshift codes. Finally, a comparison is
        made between the performance of the photometric methodologies
        and of the redshift codes to demonstrate an exceptional degree
        of self-consistency in the resulting photometric redshifts. The
        i < 21 sources have subpercent photometric redshift accuracy and
        even the faintest sources at 25 < i < 27 reach a precision of
        5\%. Finally, these results are discussed in the context of
        previous, current, and future surveys in the COSMOS field.
        Compared to COSMOS2015, it reaches the same photometric redshift
        precision at almost one magnitude deeper. Both photometric
        catalogs and their photometric redshift solutions and physical
        parameters will be made available through the usual astronomical
        archive systems (ESO Phase 3, IPAC-IRSA, and CDS).}",

        (effectively \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde221 arcmin$^{2}$ in

        IRAC Channel-2 band (CH2, 4.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m; median CH2 =
        22.46 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.11 AB mag) that lack robust

        brightest H-faint galaxy at 4.5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m known so far
        (CH2 = 20.48 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03 AB mag). We show that the

        star-forming (median star formation rate $={100}_{-40}^{+60}$ M

        indicating that H-faint galaxies represent the dusty tail of the
        distribution of a wider galaxy population. Comparing with the
        ALMA dust continuum sizes of similar galaxies reported
        previously, we conclude that the heavy dust obscuration in
        H-faint galaxies is related to the compactness of both stellar
        and dust continua (R $_{e,circ}$
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1 kpc). These H-faint galaxies

        contiguous survey conducted to date, the Mapping Obscuration to

        at 2 mm. Twelve of 13 detections above 5{\ensuremath{\sigma}}
        are attributed to emission from galaxies, 11 of which are
        dominated by cold dust emission. These sources have a median
        redshift of $\langle {z}_{2\,\mathrm{mm}}\rangle
        ={3.6}_{-0.3}^{+0.4}$ primarily based on optical/near-infrared
        photometric redshifts with some spectroscopic redshifts, with
        77\% {\ensuremath{\pm}} 11\% of sources at z > 3 and 38\%
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 12\% of sources at z > 4. This implies that 2
        mm selection is an efficient method for identifying the highest-
        redshift dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Lower-redshift
        DSFGs (z < 3) are far more numerous than those at z > 3 yet are
        likely to drop out at 2 mm. MORA shows that DSFGs with star
        formation rates in excess of 300 M $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$

        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10$^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ contribute

        formation rate density at 3 < z < 6. The volume density of 2 mm
        selected DSFGs is consistent with predictions from some
        cosmological simulations and is similar to the volume density of
        their hypothesized descendants: massive, quiescent galaxies at z
        > 2. Analysis of MORA sources' spectral energy distributions
        hint at steeper empirically measured dust emissivity indices
        than reported in typical literature studies, with $\langle \beta
        \rangle ={2.2}_{-0.4}^{+0.5}$ . The MORA survey represents an
        important step in taking census of obscured star formation in
        the universe's first few billion years, but larger area 2 mm
        surveys are needed to more fully characterize this rare
        population and push to the detection of the universe's first

        stellar mass, and specific star formation rate. The f$_{dust}$
        is found to increase by a factor of 10 from z = 0 to z = 2 and
        appears to remain flat at higher z, mirroring the evolution of
        the gas fraction. We also find a growing fraction of warm to
        cold dust with increasing distance from the main sequence,
        indicative of more intense interstellar radiation fields, higher
        star formation efficiencies, and more compact star-forming
        regions for starburst galaxies. Finally, we construct the dust
        mass functions (DMFs) of star-forming galaxies up to z = 1 by
        transforming the stellar mass function to DMF through the
        scaling relations derived here. The evolution of f$_{dust}$ and
        the recovered DMFs are in good agreement with the theoretical
        predictions of the Horizon-AGN and IllustrisTNG simulations. *

        gradients in the optical spectral indices of post-starburst
        (PSB) galaxies, which can be used to constrain their formation
        histories. We study the spectral indices of post-processed mock
        IFS datacubes of binary merger simulations, carefully matched to
        the properties of the MaNGA IFS survey, with a variety of black
        hole (BH) feedback models, progenitor galaxies, orbits, and mass
        ratios. Based on our simulation sample, we find that only major
        mergers on prograde-prograde or retrograde-prograde orbits in
        combination with a mechanical BH feedback model can form
        galaxies with weak enough ongoing star formation, and therefore
        absent H {\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission, to be selected by
        traditional PSB selection methods. We find strong fluctuations
        in nebular emission line strengths, even within the PSB phase,
        suggesting that H {\ensuremath{\alpha}} selected PSBs are only a
        subsample of the underlying population. The global PSB
        population can be more robustly identified using stellar
        continuum-based approaches. The difficulty in reproducing the
        very young PSBs in simulations potentially indicates that new
        sub-resolution star formation recipes are required to properly
        model the process of star formation quenching. In our
        simulations, we find that the starburst peaks at the same time
        at all radii, but is stronger and more prolonged in the inner
        regions. This results in a strong time evolution in the radial
        gradients of the spectral indices that can be used to estimate
        the age of the starburst without reliance on detailed star
        formation histories from spectral synthesis models.}",

        quiescent galaxies has proven difficult because of their near-
        degeneracy with interlopers such as dusty, star-forming
        galaxies. We describe a new technique for selecting quiescent
        galaxies based upon t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding

        dimensionality reduction. This t-SNE selection provides an
        improvement both over UVJ, removing interlopers that otherwise
        would pass color selection, and over photometric template
        fitting, more strongly toward high redshift. Due to the
        similarity between the colors of high- and low-redshift
        quiescent galaxies, under our assumptions, t-SNE outperforms
        template fitting in 63\% of trials at redshifts where a large
        training sample already exists. It also may be able to select

     abstract = "{Context. The merging of galaxies is one key aspect in our favourite
        hierarchical {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM Universe and is an
        important channel leading to massive quiescent elliptical
        galaxies. Understanding this complex transformational process is
        ongoing. \textbackslash Aims: We aim to study NGC 7252, which is
        one of the nearest major-merger galaxy remnants, observed 1 Gyr
        after the collision of presumably two gas-rich disc galaxies. It
        is therefore an ideal laboratory to study the processes inherent
        to the transformation of disc galaxies to ellipticals.
        \textbackslash Methods: We obtained wide-field IFU spectroscopy
        with the VLT-VIMOS integral-field spectrograph covering the
        central 50`` {\texttimes} 50'' of NGC 7252 to map the stellar
        and ionised gas kinematics, and the distribution and conditions
        of the ionised gas, revealing the extent of ongoing star
        formation and recent star formation history. \textbackslash
        Results: Contrary to previous studies, we find the inner gas
        disc not to be counter-rotating with respect to the stars. In
        addition, the stellar kinematics appear complex with a clear
        indication of a prolate-like rotation component which suggests a
        polar merger configuration. The ongoing star formation rate is
        2.2 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.6 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ yr$^{-1}$
        and implies a typical depletion time of 2 Gyr given the
        molecular gas content. Furthermore, the spatially resolved star
        formation history suggests a slight radial dependence, moving
        outwards at later times. We confirm a large AGN-ionised gas
        cloud previously discovered 5 kpc south of the nucleus, and find
        a higher ionisation state of the ionised gas at the galaxy
        centre relative to the surrounding gas disc. Although the higher
        ionisation towards the centre is potentially degenerate within
        the central star forming ring, it may be associated with a low-
        luminosity AGN. \textbackslash Conclusions: Although NGC 7252
        has been classified as post-starburst galaxy at the centre, the
        elliptical-like major-merger remnant still appears very active.
        A central kpc-scale gas disc has presumably re-formed quickly
        within the last 100 Myr after final coalescence. The disc
        features ongoing star formation, implying Gyr long timescale to
        reach the red sequence through gas consumption alone. While NGC
        7252 is useful to probe the transformation from discs to
        ellipticals, it is not well-suited to study the transformation
        from blue to red at this point.}",
