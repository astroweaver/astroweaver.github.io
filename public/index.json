Here we present powerful new constraints on UV emission from sources contributing to the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) at its very onset, at only 500 Myr after the Big Bang. We identify these sources with the new COSMOS2020 galaxy catalog, which utilizes new ultra-deep optical and near-infrared imaging necessary to securely identify candidate galaxies from the EoR, each with four consistent measurements of photometric redshift and UV luminosity. Encouraged by this unprecedented agreement, we confirm a highly significant departure from the expected Schechter Function form of the UV LF seen in the local universe, suggesting that galaxy evolution has yet to set in at these early times. An already approved JWST Cycle 1 program (PI: Weaver) will target five of the most robust and most UV-luminous (MUV ~ -22.5) z~9 galaxies in COSMOS with detailed spatially resolved spectroscopy. This ambitious program will comprehensively map out not only the UV emission from these galaxies, but also their dust attenuation, morphology, and stellar assembly histories. These new insights will provide the context necessary to understand the formation of the most massive, and UV-luminous galaxies in the EoR.

Using a linear model to fit the spectral variations, we isolate separate spectra for the variable (disc) non-variable(disc + galaxy) components of each quasar. We find evidence for bluer spectral slopes than predicted by cannonical accretion disc theory and excellent agreement with SMC-like dust extinction. This work provides the first direct evidence to support recent groundbreaking theoretical efforts to analytically describe accretion discs in the context of General Relativity and magnetic stress.\n ","date":1625826888,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625826888,"objectID":"dba12c4cd12427f4d56b91f50ffbe5e0","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/project/agnvar/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T10:34:48.352Z","relpermalink":"/project/agnvar/","section":"project","summary":"Using variability to determine the dust content and test models of the intrinsic spectral index of quasar variations","tags":["Black Holes"],"title":"Variable Accretion Disks","type":"project"},{"authors":["John Raymond Weaver","Gabriel Brammer","Caitlin M Casey","Nima Chartab Soltani","Iary Davidzon","Andreas L Faisst","Steven L Finkelstein","Seiji Fujimoto","Katriona Mai Landau Gould","Olivier Ilbert"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625827393,"objectID":"548c306a4d020006c71cdd728a92dd4e","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/weaver-2021-beasts/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T10:43:13.098176Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weaver-2021-beasts/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Beasts in the Bubbles: Characterizing ultra-luminous galaxies at Cosmic Dawn","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JR Weaver","O Kauffmann","M Shuntov","I Davidzon","O Ilbert","G Brammer","B Hsieh","P Capak","A Moneti","HJ McCracken"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625827392,"objectID":"27105510d810021dcdc7c84ee2f6e641","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/weaver-2021-cosmos-2020/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T10:43:11.967253Z","relpermalink":"/publication/weaver-2021-cosmos-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"COSMOS2020: A next-generation catalog to explore the 1\u003c z\u003c 8 universe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Crystal Linn Martin","L Felipe Barrientos","Andreas L Faisst","Jorge Ignacio Gonzalez Lopez","Yuichi Harikane","Weida Hu","Leopoldo Infante","Chunyan Jiang","Jeyhan Kartaltepe","Olivier Benjamin Kauffmann"," others"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625827393,"objectID":"137812e726becb7a218c89a59fce62b8","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/martin-2021-galaxy/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T10:43:13.236338Z","relpermalink":"/publication/martin-2021-galaxy/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Galaxy Protoclusters as Drivers of Cosmic Reionization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas L Faisst","Ranga Ram Chary","Sergio Fajardo-Acosta","Roberta Paladini","Benjamin Rusholme","Nathaniel Stickley","George Helou","John R Weaver","Anton M Koekemoer","Hironao Miyatake"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625827392,"objectID":"c77bcef95447b97a406837c1cbd6f025","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/faisst-2021-joint/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T10:43:12.399739Z","relpermalink":"/publication/faisst-2021-joint/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Joint Survey Processing I: Compact oddballs in the COSMOS field--low-luminosity Quasars at z\u003e 6?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John R.

The unique combination of a wide-field near-infrared imaging coupled with new ultra-deep optical and infrared data makes this the most secure sample of 9\u0026lt;z\u0026lt;10 galaxy candidates currently available. However, these objects are too rare to be found by very deep, but smaller surveys with JWST, and the serendipitous discovery of even one such galaxy outside of COSMOS is unlikely from the entirety of planned GTO and ERS programs. These massive, luminous galaxies, seen only 500 million years after the Big Bang, are ideal tracers of the primordial dark matter structures from which they formed and grew. However, their mere existence at these early times challenges the current paradigm of early galaxy formation and evolution. Thus, it is essential to confirm their high redshift nature and reveal the means by which these remarkable cosmic beasts so rapidly built up their stellar mass.\n
