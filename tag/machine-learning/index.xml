&lt;p>Large photometric surveys provide a rich source of observations of quiescent galaxies, including a surprisingly large population at z &amp;gt; 1. However, identifying large, but clean, samples of quiescent galaxies has proven difficult because of their near-degeneracy with interlopers such as dusty, star-forming galaxies. We describe a new technique for selecting quiescent galaxies based upon t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding which provides an improvement both over UVJ. It also may be able to select quiescent galaxies more efficiently at higher redshifts than the training sample.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this project a neural network has been designed to classify stars and galaxies, where an optimal use of information and structure of the neural network has been investigated. Thus, the project presents a computationally fast methodology with the freedom to choose between quantity and purity that can accurately predict more than 95 percent of stars and galaxies.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
