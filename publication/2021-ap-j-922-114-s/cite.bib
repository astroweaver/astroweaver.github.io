 abstract = {We present a Spitzer/IRAC survey of H-faint (H $_160$
\ensuremath\gtrsim 26.4, < 5\ensuremathσ) sources
in 101 lensing cluster fields. Across a CANDELS/Wide-like survey
area of åisebox-0.5ex~648 arcmin$^2$
(effectively \i̊sebox-0.5ex~221 arcmin$^2$ in
the source plane), we have securely discovered 53 sources in the
IRAC Channel-2 band (CH2, 4.5 \ensuremathμm; median CH2 =
22.46 \ensuremath± 0.11 AB mag) that lack robust
HST/WFC3-IR F160W counterparts. The most remarkable source in
our sample, namely ES-009 in the field of Abell 2813, is the
brightest H-faint galaxy at 4.5 \ensuremathμm known so far
(CH2 = 20.48 \ensuremath± 0.03 AB mag). We show that the
H-faint sources in our sample are massive (median M $_star$ =
10$^10.3\ensuremath±0.3$ M $_\ensuremathødot$),
star-forming (median star formation rate $=100_-40^+60$ M
$_\ensuremathødot$ yr$^-1$), and dust-obscured (A $_ V
$ = 2.6 \ensuremath± 0.3) galaxies around a median
photometric redshift of z = 3.9 \ensuremath± 0.4. The
stellar continua of 14 H-faint galaxies can be resolved in the
CH2 band, suggesting a median circularized effective radius (R
$_e,circ$; lensing corrected) of 1.9 \ensuremath± 0.2
kpc and <1.5 kpc for the resolved and whole samples,
respectively. This is consistent with the sizes of massive
unobscured galaxies at z \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~ 4,
indicating that H-faint galaxies represent the dusty tail of the
distribution of a wider galaxy population. Comparing with the
ALMA dust continuum sizes of similar galaxies reported
previously, we conclude that the heavy dust obscuration in
H-faint galaxies is related to the compactness of both stellar
and dust continua (R $_e,circ$
\rae̊box-0.5ex~ 1 kpc). These H-faint galaxies
make up $16_-7^+13$ % of the galaxies in the stellar-mass
range of 10$^10$ - 10$^11.2$ M $_\ensuremathødot$
at z = 3 \raib̊ox-0.5ex~ 5, contributing to
$8_-4^+8$ % of the cosmic star formation rate density in
this epoch and likely tracing the early phase of massive galaxy
formation.},
