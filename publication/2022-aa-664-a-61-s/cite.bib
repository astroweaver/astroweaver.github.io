 abstract = {We used the COSMOS2020 catalog to measure the stellar-to-halo mass
relation (SHMR) divided by central and satellite galaxies from z
= 0.2 to z = 5.5. Starting from accurate photometric redshifts,
we measured the near-infrared selected two-point angular
correlation and stellar mass functions in ten redshift bins. We
used a phenomenological model that parametrizes the stellar-to-
halo mass relation for central galaxies and the number of
galaxies inside each halo to describe our observations. This
model qualitatively reproduces our measurements and their
dependence on the stellar mass threshold. Surprisingly, the mean
halo occupation distribution only shows a mild evolution with
redshift suggesting that galaxies occupy halos similarly
throughout cosmic time. At each redshift, we measured the ratio
of stellar mass to halo mass, M$_*$/M$_h$, which shows the
characteristic strong dependence of halo mass with a peak at
M$_h$$^peak$ \ensuremath∼ 2 × 10$^12$
M$_\ensuremathødot$. For the first time, using a joint
modeling of clustering and abundances, we measured the evolution
of M$_h$$^peak$ from z = 0.2 to z = 5.5. M$_h$$^peak$
increases gradually with redshift from log
M$_h$$^peak$/M$_\ensuremathødot$ \ensuremath∼
12.1 at z \ensuremath∼ 0.3 to log
M$_h$$^peak$/M$_\ensuremathødot$ \ensuremath∼
12.3 at z \ensuremath∼ 2, and up to log
M$_h$$^peak$/M$_\ensuremathødot$ \ensuremath∼
12.9 at z \ensuremath∼ 5. Similarly, the stellar mass
peak M$_\ensuremath*$$^peak$ increases with redshift
from log
M$_\ensuremath*$$^peak$/M$_\ensuremathødot$
\ensuremath∼ 10.5 at z \ensuremath∼ 0.3 to log
M$_\ensuremath*$$^peak$/M$_\ensuremathødot$
\ensuremath∼ 10.9 at z \ensuremath∼ 3. The SHMR
ratio at the peak halo mass remains almost constant with
redshift. These results are in accordance with the scenario in
which the peak of star-formation efficiency moves toward more
massive halos at higher redshifts. We also measured the fraction
of satellites as a function of stellar mass and redshift. For
all stellar mass thresholds, the satellite fraction decreases at
higher redshifts. At a given redshift, there is a higher
fraction of low-mass satellites and this fraction reaches a
plateau at \ensuremath∼25% at z \ensuremath∼ 1.
The satellite contribution to the total stellar mass budget in
halos becomes more important than that of the central at halo
masses of about M$_h$ > 10$^13$ M$_\ensuremathødot$
and always stays below the peak, indicating that quenching
mechanisms are present in massive halos that keep the star-
formation efficiency low. Finally, we compared our results with
three hydrodynamical simulations: HORIZON-AGN, TNG100 of the
ILLUSTRISTNG project, and EAGLE. We find that the most
significant discrepancy is at the high-mass end, where the
simulations generally show that satellites have a higher
contribution to the total stellar mass budget than the
observations. This, together with the finding that the fraction
of satellites is higher in the simulations, indicates that the
feedback mechanisms acting in both group- and cluster-scale
halos appear to be less efficient in quenching the mass assembly
of satellites - and that quenching occurs much later in the
simulations.},
