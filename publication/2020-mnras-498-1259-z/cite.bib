 abstract = {Recent integral field spectroscopic (IFS) surveys have revealed radial
gradients in the optical spectral indices of post-starburst
(PSB) galaxies, which can be used to constrain their formation
histories. We study the spectral indices of post-processed mock
IFS datacubes of binary merger simulations, carefully matched to
the properties of the MaNGA IFS survey, with a variety of black
hole (BH) feedback models, progenitor galaxies, orbits, and mass
ratios. Based on our simulation sample, we find that only major
mergers on prograde-prograde or retrograde-prograde orbits in
combination with a mechanical BH feedback model can form
galaxies with weak enough ongoing star formation, and therefore
absent H \ensuremathα emission, to be selected by
traditional PSB selection methods. We find strong fluctuations
in nebular emission line strengths, even within the PSB phase,
suggesting that H \ensuremathα selected PSBs are only a
subsample of the underlying population. The global PSB
population can be more robustly identified using stellar
continuum-based approaches. The difficulty in reproducing the
very young PSBs in simulations potentially indicates that new
sub-resolution star formation recipes are required to properly
model the process of star formation quenching. In our
simulations, we find that the starburst peaks at the same time
at all radii, but is stronger and more prolonged in the inner
regions. This results in a strong time evolution in the radial
gradients of the spectral indices that can be used to estimate
the age of the starburst without reliance on detailed star
formation histories from spectral synthesis models.},
