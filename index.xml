&lt;p>We propose restframe UV and optical spectroscopy to confirm redshifts and measure star-formation rates, stellar masses, and dust extinction for the five most luminous
galaxies at 9&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;10 over two square degrees of the COSMOS survey. The unique combination of a wide-field near-infrared imaging coupled with new ultra-deep optical
and infrared data makes this the most secure sample of 9&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;10 galaxy candidates currently available. However, these objects are too rare to be found by very deep,
but smaller surveys with JWST, and the serendipitous discovery of even one such galaxy outside of COSMOS is unlikely from the entirety of planned GTO and ERS
programs. These massive, luminous galaxies, seen only 500 million years after the Big Bang, are ideal tracers of the primordial dark matter structures from which they
formed and grew. However, their mere existence at these early times challenges the current paradigm of early galaxy formation and evolution. Thus, it is essential to
confirm their high redshift nature and reveal the means by which these remarkable cosmic beasts so rapidly built up their stellar mass.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Galaxy Protoclusters as Drivers of Cosmic Reionization</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_jwst_protocluster_martin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_jwst_protocluster_martin/</guid><description>&lt;p>JWST / NIRCam+NIRSpec | Cycle 1 | 25.2+9.7hrs | PI - C.

&lt;p>The environmental dependence of galaxy properties today requires an accelerated assembly history in high density environments. Protoclusters, the overdense regions of
the universe that ultimately collapse into massive galaxy clusters, contribute a significant fraction of all cosmic star formation during the era of reionization. The galaxy
overdensity may enhance the escape of ionizing photons, making protoclusters crucial in driving the timing and topology of cosmic reionization. We propose to measure
the brightest rest-frame-optical emission lines from spectrosopically-confirmed galaxies comprising the largest overdensity yet identified near the midpoint of cosmic
reionization, z7OD. Eight protocluster members, identified by their Lyman-alpha emission, are the primary targets for these NIRSpec MOS observations, which will
measure rest-frame optical emission lines between the [OII] doublet and hydrogen Balmer alpha lines. We aim to measure the transmission of the IGM in and around an
ionized, cosmic bubble, determine the physical properties of the galaxies that ionized the bubble, and compare them to field galaxies at z &amp;gt; 3.37 (observed
simultaneously). We will measure the Lyman-alpha escape fraction and the Lyman-alpha velocity offset, information required to map spatial variation in IGM transmission.
Protoclusters at this redshift are predicted to contain significant amount of cold gas, possibly triggering high specific star formation rates and accelerating the chemical
evolution of the galaxies; ideas we will test by directly measuring diagnostic emission-line ratios&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dust and the intrinsic spectral index of quasar variations: hints of finite stress at the innermost stable circular orbit</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2022-mnras-512-899-w/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2022-mnras-512-899-w/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Euclid preparation: XXI.

&lt;p>We propose the Webb Epoch of Reionization Lyman-alpha Survey (WERLS), a spectroscopic redshift survey using MOSFIRE and LRIS, targeting ~800 galaxies embedded within the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) at 6&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;8. Our goals are to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>conduct a census of Ly-alpha emission in already identified luminous EoR galaxies (M_UV&amp;lt; -21) to map ionization bubbles in the intergalactic medium at a time when the Universe was partially ionized and on scales much larger than the expected size of ionization bubbles,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>directly compare the Ly-alpha-inferred location of ionization bubbles to underlying galaxy density maps that will be measured via deep Webb NIRCam imaging to directly constrain the galaxies responsible for reionization, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>increase the number of spectroscopically-confirmed bright EoR sources by a factor of ~2-4x within 6&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;8 via firm detection of Ly-alpha emission, which will critically inform photometric redshift calibration of fainter EoR-era galaxies exclusively detected by Webb.
This survey will be conducted in preparation for, and in conjunction with, the largest and deepest extragalactic imaging surveys from the James Webb Space Telescope Cycle 1 and ERS programs covering 0.7deg^2: COSMOS-Webb, PRIMER-UDS, and CEERS. These programs aim to reveal several thousands of EoR galaxies and map their distribution in large scale structure on 10-100Mpc scales. WERLS will focus on already-identified bright galaxies in these surveys, which likely trace the highest mass overdensities to be found by Webb; detection of Lyman-alpha will reveal whether or not they live in ionized bubbles.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) has become a cornerstone of extragalactic astronomy. Since the last public catalog in 2015, a wealth of new imaging and spectroscopic data has been collected in the COSMOS field. This paper describes the collection, processing, and analysis of this new imaging data to produce a new reference photometric redshift catalog. Source detection and multi-wavelength photometry is performed for 1.7 million sources across the 2deg2 of the COSMOS field, ∼966,000 of which are measured with all available broad-band data using both traditional aperture photometric methods and a new profile-fitting photometric extraction tool, The Farmer, which we have developed. A detailed comparison of the two resulting photometric catalogs is presented. Photometric redshifts are computed for all sources in each catalog utilizing two independent photometric redshift codes. Finally, a comparison is made between the performance of the photometric methodologies and of the redshift codes to demonstrate an exceptional degree of self-consistency in the resulting photometric redshifts. The i&amp;lt;21 sources have sub-percent photometric redshift accuracy and even the faintest sources at 25&amp;lt;i&amp;lt;27 reach a precision of 5%. Finally, these results are discussed in the context of previous, current, and future surveys in the COSMOS field. Compared to COSMOS2015, reaches the same photometric redshift precision at almost one magnitude deeper. Both photometric catalogs and their photometric redshift solutions and physical parameters will be made available through the usual astronomical archive systems (ESO Phase 3, IPAC IRSA, and CDS).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beasts in the Bubbles: Remarkably UV-bright Galaxies at z=9-10</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_keck_beasts_casey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_keck_beasts_casey/</guid><description>&lt;p>Keck/MOSFIRE | 2N | PI - C.

&lt;p>We propose Keck MOSFIRE J-band spectroscopy for four UV-bright (H=24.5&amp;ndash;25.4 mag) novel photometric candidates at z=9-10 from the new COSMOS2020 catalogs, with deeper, homogeneous near-IR and ultra-deep optical coverage that allowed for the identification of such rare, extraordinary candidates. All candidates have (a) clear Lyman-break features from Y to H bands, (b) IRAC detection, (c) tight distributions in PDF(z) at z=9-10, (d) inconsistency with common high-z galaxy contaminants (low-mass stars and dusty lower-z galaxies), and (e) are estimated to sit at z&amp;gt;9 with four independent fits to their photometry. The volume density of these four candidates is also consistent with the bright-end of the latest UV luminosity function (UVLF) studies at z=9-10. With the proposed observations, we will achieve the following three major goals: 1) redshift confirmation and thus the power-law nature of the UVLF at z=9-10; 2) testing if UV-bright galaxies at z=9-10 reside in ionized bubbles; and 3) if they host AGN measured via the Nv1243 line. Importantly, our targets are &amp;gt; 10-20 times brighter than the only other source confirmed with line emission at these redshifts. The spectroscopic confirmation of our targets will provide essential constraints on the bright/massive-end of luminosity/mass function at z&amp;gt;9 and the cold dark matter formation of early, massive galaxies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beasts in the Bubbles: Remarkably UV-bright Galaxies at z=9-10</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_subaru_beasts_fujimoto/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_subaru_beasts_fujimoto/</guid><description>&lt;p>Subaru/SWIMS | 1.5N | PI - S.

&lt;p>We propose Keck MOSFIRE J-band spectroscopy for five UV-bright (H =24.5–25.4 mag) novel photometric candidates at z = 9 − 10 from the brand new COSMOS2020 catalogs, now benefitting from homogeneous near-IR and ultra-deep optical coverage that allowed for such identification. All candidates have clear Lyman-break features from Y to H bands, IRAC detection, tight distributions in PDF(z) at z = 9 − 10, the inconsistency with the templates of the stellar and dusty galaxy at lower redshift, and are confirmed at z &amp;gt; 9 with four independent redshift estimates. The volume density of these five candidates is also consistent with the bright-end of the latest UV luminosity function (UVLF) studies at z = 9 − 10. With the proposed observations, we will achieve the following two major goals: 1) confirming the redshift and the power-law nature of the UVLF at z = 9 − 10, and 2) testing if UV-bright galaxies at z = 9 − 10 host AGN via the Nv1243 line. Importantly, our targets are &amp;gt; ×10–20 brighter than the only other source confirmed at z = 9.11. Our targets will provide essential constraints on the bright/massive-end of luminosity/mass function at z &amp;gt; 9 and the CDM scenario for the formation of early galaxies, once at least one of their redshifts are confirmed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COSMOS2020: New Insights into Galaxy Assembly and Evolution over the first 10 Billion Years</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/talk/aas2022/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/talk/aas2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>The COSMOS field has proved to be one of the cornerstone surveys in extragalactic astronomy. We have built a new photometric redshift catalog COSMOS2020 from the latest ultra-deep imaging from Subaru, VISTA, and Spitzer. We measure 1M sources across the 2deg2 field using both apertures and profile-fitting photometry, pairing each with two SED fitting codes to derive four sets of precise photometric redshifts. We then measure the form and evolution the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function from 0.2 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 7.5 to reveal a strikingly constant rate of mass assembly stretching back into the Epoch of Reionization. We also find new samples of ultra-luminous galaxies at z&amp;gt;7.5 which form the most robust constraints on the UV Luminosity Function at such early times, confirming an excess of luminous sources. Are we witnessing a stage before feedback has suppressed their growth? Such a scenario challenges galaxy formation theory.

Our two candidates have 1) sharp Lyman break features; 2) IRAC detection; 3) tight photo-z solutions. The volume density of these objects is consistent with the bright-end of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) studies at z=9-10 that suggests a double power-law.
We aim to identify these objects by [OIII], which is proven to be the best FIR line to observe z&amp;gt;8 galaxies. A successful detection will confirm the power-law nature of the UVLF for the first time by spectroscopy. This has significant implication in the field of galaxy formation as they would represent a transition before significant dust attenuation and mass quenching. We will also directly observe the dust continuum,which is crucial to test the dust-poor hypothesis as the physical origins of the brightest galaxies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deep spectroscopy of bright red massive quiescent galaxies at z~2.5-3 in COSMOS</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_vlt_z3qg_valentino/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_vlt_z3qg_valentino/</guid><description>&lt;p>VLT/XSHOOTER | 56.0hrs| PI - F.

&lt;p>We propose to observe with X-Shooter a statistical sample of 7 bright (K&amp;lt;21 mag), massive (M*&amp;gt;1e11 Msun), and quiescent (sSFR&amp;lt;1e-9.5/yr) galaxies at z~2.5-3 selected from the brand-new COSMOS2020 catalog. The sample encloses all the galaxies in the 2sq.deg. field fulfilling these criteria and spans a range of SED shapes consistent with different formation and quenching epochs. From the spectra, we will measure accurate redshifts, ages, stellar velocity dispersions (σ_vel), and estimate possible residual unobscured SFR and/or AGN contamination from emission lines, if present. This will allow us to reconstruct the SFH from the combined spectra+SED modeling and to directly compare them with custom mock observations extracted from simulations for a systematic analysis of the history of formation of these systems. Estimates of σ_vel will also allow for a first test for the existence dynamical scaling relations at such high redshifts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deep Subaru HSC z-band imaging of the Euclid/JWST/Roman Deep Field</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_subaru_nep_suzuki/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_subaru_nep_suzuki/</guid><description>&lt;p>Subaru/HSC | 2N | PI - N.

&lt;p>We request 2 nights of Subaru Hyper-SuprimeCam to complete z-band observations of the largest multi-wavelength (ugriz) field, Hawaii Two-0 (H20), a contiguous survey covering 20 sq. deg area of two primary Euclid Deep Calibration Fields (NEP and CDFS). A total of 30 nights on the Subaru/HSC and 10 nights on the Keck/DEIMOS telescopes were allocated for this program through the Hawaii TAC which has now completed g-, r-, i- band coverage. This proposal is to complete the z-band photometric survey in the NEP field to the desired depth of 26.5 AB. The z-band data are essential for accurate physical parameter measurements of galaxies at 0 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 3 (e.g., photometric redshift and stellar mass) and selection of galaxies at 3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 6 . These measurements will allow us to study the evolution of massive galaxies to z~6, estimate the properties of their dark matter haloes through clustering measurements, and find rare objects that are re-ionizing the universe. This is a legacy Euclid program.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exploring UV-bright galaxies at z~9-10</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_keck_beasts_mobasher/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_keck_beasts_mobasher/</guid><description>&lt;p>Keck/MOSFIRE | 2N | PI - B.

&lt;p>The environmental dependence of galaxy properties today requires an accelerated assembly history in high density environments. Protoclusters, the overdense regions of
the universe that ultimately collapse into massive galaxy clusters, contribute a significant fraction of all cosmic star formation during the era of reionization. The galaxy
overdensity may enhance the escape of ionizing photons, making protoclusters crucial in driving the timing and topology of cosmic reionization. We propose to measure
the brightest rest-frame-optical emission lines from spectrosopically-confirmed galaxies comprising the largest overdensity yet identified near the midpoint of cosmic
reionization, z7OD. Eight protocluster members, identified by their Lyman-alpha emission, are the primary targets for these NIRSpec MOS observations, which will
measure rest-frame optical emission lines between the [OII] doublet and hydrogen Balmer alpha lines. We aim to measure the transmission of the IGM in and around an
ionized, cosmic bubble, determine the physical properties of the galaxies that ionized the bubble, and compare them to field galaxies at z &amp;gt; 3.37 (observed
simultaneously). We will measure the Lyman-alpha escape fraction and the Lyman-alpha velocity offset, information required to map spatial variation in IGM transmission.
Protoclusters at this redshift are predicted to contain significant amount of cold gas, possibly triggering high specific star formation rates and accelerating the chemical
evolution of the galaxies; ideas we will test by directly measuring diagnostic emission-line ratios&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First accurate constraint of cold dust and gas properties in the EoR</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_noema_dust_liu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_noema_dust_liu/</guid><description>&lt;p>NOEMA | 20.0hrs | PI - D. Liu&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How galaxies grow their metals and stellar masses in the first few hundred million years is a fundamental question. The evolution of cold gas depletion time, gas fraction and dust temperature is well established out to redshift z~5, however, little is known in the epoch of reionization (EoR). The insufficient number of spectroscopically identified EoR galaxies and their extreme faintness in dust continuum are the main reasons hampering an accurate determination of their dust and cold gas properties. Here we select the newly-confirmed, 1.3mm-brightest and most-massive/dusty EoR target (with robust [CII] spec-z=7.31) among the 40+ known spec-z&amp;gt;6.5 galaxies in the EoR to detect its Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) tail rest-frame 250um flux at 2mm using 20 hours of NOEMA time. This is the first RJ dust study in the EoR, and will make the target the first golden reference for: a) accurate (cold) dust and gas properties; b) CII vs. RJ dust continuum cold gas mass calibration for high-z CII studies; c) cold gas depletion time, gas fraction and dust temperature evolution towards z~7.3.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Follow-up spectroscopy for a protocluster of quiescent galaxies at z = 2.8</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_subaru_ito/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_subaru_ito/</guid><description>&lt;p>Keck/MOSFIRE | 1N | PI - K.

&lt;p>We propose to conduct MOSFIRE spectroscopy for an overdense
region of massive (log M⋆/M⊙&amp;gt;10.5) quiescent galaxies at z= 2.8, which is newly found from the latest COSMOS2020 catalog. Though
many passive galaxies exist in local
galaxy clusters, most known protoclusters are found by only star
-forming galaxies. Protoclusters consisting of quiescent
galaxies had not been found at
z &amp;gt; 2. The high-redshift structures of quiescent galaxies are unique a
nd expected to
provide an insight into the (proto)cluster evolution and the connec
tion between the environment and the quenching. Our
goals of this proposal are 1). to spectroscopically confirm the str
ucture from Balmer absorption lines of 12 quiescent
galaxies therein and 2). to explore their star formation history thr
ough the observed spectrum and plenty of multi-band
photometry data. The derived star formation history will conclude
the primordial environmental effect on the stellar age
and constrain the progenitor of this structure. If this structur
e is spectroscopically confirmed, this is the most distant
protocluster of quiescent galaxies, which will be an ideal laboratory
for conducting the follow-up observation, such as by
ALMA.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The emergence of the first quiescent galaxies - take 2</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_subaru_tanaka/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_subaru_tanaka/</guid><description>&lt;p>Keck/MOSFIRE | 2N | PI - M. Tanaka&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We propose for 2 nights of Keck/MOSFIRE observations to follow-up a z ∼ 4.7 quiescent galaxy in COSMOS as part of our on-going campaign to build a sample of distant quenched/quenching galaxies. From our previous runs (S17B- 106, S18B-040, S20B-031),(1) we have confirmed three z = 4.010, 3.99 and 3.775 galaxies, all of which are the highest redshift quiescent galaxies known to date, and (2) we have measured stellar velocity dispersions of the z = 4.010 and 3.99 galaxies, revealing that the mass in the core of these galaxies does not significantly evolve over the last 12 Gyr, which is consistent with the 2-phase formation scenario. Building upon three papers from our previous runs (Tanaka+ 2019, Valentino+ 2020, Tanaka+ in prep), we now propose to observe the most distant quenching galaxy candidate from our sample in COSMOS at z ∼ 4.7 based on the latest COSMOS2020 catalog with superb photometric quality. We aim (1) to spectroscopically confirm the emergence of the first quiescent galaxies when the Universe was only 1.2 Gyr old, and (2) to fully capture the Balmer break in the K-band to measure their star formation epoch and timescale, which will, combined with state-of-the-art simulations, give us new insights into key physics of very early quenching.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Uncovering a unique population of gas giants at &lt;z>=1.2</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_noema_giants_kokorev/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_noema_giants_kokorev/</guid><description>&lt;p>NOEMA | 8.0hrs | PI - V.

&lt;p>We have discovered a new population of galaxies in the distant Universe (z&amp;gt;1) with extremely cold dust temperatures, similar to the coldest galaxies in the local Universe. Taken at face value, this corresponds to very large dust masses and, as a result, extreme gas fractions. The nature of these galaxies is puzzling, as such extreme gas enrichment are not predicted by either theoretical models or existing empirical observations. We propose to infer and confirm the gas mass (Mgas), and the dust mass (Mdust) for two &amp;ldquo;gas-giants&amp;rdquo; at &lt;z>=1.2, that lie on the main-sequence of star-formation. Our goal is to detect the CO(2-1) emission line, as well as the dust continuum at rest frame 1.2 mm, with a set of efficiently designed observations.These observations will target a robustly selected, representative sample of these objects, to act as a pilot study into these unique and unexpected systems. In particular with the proposed observations we will 1) explore and put constraints the dust/gas masses and fractions in these giants 2) confirm the extreme nature of these objects to facilitate a larger follow-up proposal to observe the full population.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COSMOS2020: A Panchromatic View of the Universe to z 10 from Two Complementary Catalogs</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2022-ap-js-258-11-w/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2022-ap-js-258-11-w/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Beasts in the Bubbles: Discovering the origins of the first massive galaxies with JWST</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/talk/eso2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/talk/eso2021/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recent observations of the early universe have suggested the impossible: an abundance of ultra-massive, dead galaxies already within 1.5 billion years after the big bang.

Yet, their existence challenges contemporary models of galaxy formation. I will utilize the first observations with JWST to identify their star-forming progenitors, characterize their properties, assess their contribution to reionization, and critically test models of galaxy formation. My Cycle 1 program to observe five massive z ∼ 9 beasts is uniquely suited to the task, and will provide insight into the formation of the first massive galaxies to light up the cosmos.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Extensive Lensing Survey of Optical and Near-infrared Dark Objects (El Sonido): HST H-faint Galaxies behind 101 Lensing Clusters</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2021-ap-j-922-114-s/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2021-ap-j-922-114-s/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mapping Obscuration to Reionization with ALMA (MORA): 2 mm Efficiently Selects the Highest-redshift Obscured Galaxies</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2021-ap-j-923-215-c/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2021-ap-j-923-215-c/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Evolving Interstellar Medium of Star-forming Galaxies, as Traced by Stardust</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2021-ap-j-921-40-k/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2021-ap-j-921-40-k/</guid><description/></item><item><title>In Search of Fossils: A method to distinguish Quiescent and Dusty Star-forming Galaxies with t-SNE</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/talk/iapml2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/talk/iapml2021/</guid><description>&lt;p>Large galaxy surveys have revealed a surprising number of galaxies that have ceased (or quenched) their star-formation, seen as they were when the Universe was only half its current age. However, identifying large, but clean, samples of these “quiescent” galaxies has proven difficult. Their spectral shapes, as measured by broad-band photometric measurements, are highly degenerate with dusty star-forming galaxies whose light is attenuated by thick clouds of dust and present as an interloper population. We describe a new technique for identifying pure samples of quiescent galaxies based upon t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction. This t-SNE selection provides an improvement in both purity and completeness over traditional methods (e.g. UVJ, NUVrJ) and over spectral template fitting. We find that t-SNE outperforms spectral fitting in 63% of trials at distances where large training samples already exist. Remarkably, we find evidence for increased performance when applying the method to samples in the even more distant Universe.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COSMOS2020: A panchromatic view of the Universe to $z∼10$ from two complementary catalogs</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2021-ar-xiv-211013923-w/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2021-ar-xiv-211013923-w/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Euclid preparation: XVIII.

most massive and most UV-luminous galaxies at z &amp;gt; 8, and their growth in
relation to large-scale structure and reionization, are derived from
measurements of the UV Luminosity Function (UV LF). Here we present powerful
new constraints on UV emission from sources contributing to the Epoch of
Reionization (EoR) at its very onset, at only 500 Myr after the Big Bang. We
identify these sources with the new COSMOS2020 galaxy catalog, which utilizes
new ultra-deep optical and near-infrared imaging necessary to securely
identify candidate galaxies from the EoR, each with four consistent
measurements of photometric redshift and UV luminosity. Encouraged by this
unprecedented agreement, we confirm a highly significant departure from the
expected Schechter Function form of the UV LF seen in the local universe,
suggesting that galaxy evolution has yet to set in at these early times. An
already approved JWST Cycle 1 program (PI: Weaver) will target five of the
most robust and most UV-luminous (MUV ~ -22.5) z~9 galaxies in COSMOS with
detailed spatially resolved spectroscopy. This ambitious program will
comprehensively map out not only the UV emission from these galaxies, but also
their dust attenuation, morphology, and stellar assembly histories. These new
insights will provide the context necessary to understand the formation of the
most massive, and UV-luminous galaxies in the EoR.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AAVSO's Stellar Spectroscopy Database</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/outreach/aavso/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 10:34:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/outreach/aavso/</guid><description>&lt;p>AVSpec is the first spectral database of the &lt;a href="www.aavso.org">American Association of Variable Star Observers&lt;/a>.

I lead the 2020 edition of the master galaxy catalog, using bleeding-edge galaxy model-fitting techniques from The Farmer to measure galaxy properties.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Distinguishing Quiescent and Dusty Star-forming Galaxies</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/project/qg_tsne/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 10:34:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/project/qg_tsne/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Large photometric surveys provide a rich source of observations of quiescent galaxies, including a surprisingly large population at z &amp;gt; 1. However, identifying large, but clean, samples of quiescent galaxies has proven difficult because of their near-degeneracy with interlopers such as dusty, star-forming galaxies. We describe a new technique for selecting quiescent galaxies based upon t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding which provides an improvement both over UVJ. It also may be able to select quiescent galaxies more efficiently at higher redshifts than the training sample.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Post-starburst Galaxies (PSBs) are characterised by a lack of massive, young blue stars and a large fraction of intermediate mass A- and F-type stars. They are interpreted as a population of galaxies which have recently undergone a major episode of star formation, and their study may elucidate the nature of galaxy bimodality.
We employ a principal component analysis to study a sample of 32 low redshift (0.01 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.11) PSBs selected with SDSS DR 7 single-fibre spectroscopy and observed with MaNGA integral field spectroscopy. Morphologies are examined to characterise the sample, finding a mixture of starforming and quiescent parameters, indicative of tran- sition. We find that this rich sample exhibits strong radial gradients in stellar age, as measured by the principal components (PC) corresponding to the 4000-Å break strength and excess Hδ absorption. To examine the extent of aperture bias, we com- pare these two properties between the DR 7 and MaNGA spectra, integrated over 3&amp;quot; and the full aperture, finding evidence for systematics and radial gradients. We em- ploy two stellar population synthesis codes (BC03, FSPS) to test the manner in which star-formation proceeded, either as a single radially evolving burst, or coeval with varying burst strengths.
Achieved here for the first time, we find a remarkable consistency between the models and gradients, suggesting complex and diverse star-formation histories. We show that this method, coupled with an increased sample size, is well-suited to elucidate the real nature of these strange and peculiar objects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Galaxy Stellar Mass Assembly History Over 13 Billion Years</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/project/cosmos2020-smf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 10:34:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/project/cosmos2020-smf/</guid><description/></item><item><title>History and Destiny of a Major Merger Remnant</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/project/ngc7252/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 10:34:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/project/ngc7252/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="paper-httpsarxivorgabs180109691">PAPER: &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09691" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09691&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>NGC7252, which is one of the nearest major-merger galaxy remnants, is an ideal laboratory to study the processes inherent to the transformation of disc galaxies to ellipticals as observed about ~1Gyr after the collision. We obtained wide-field IFU spectroscopy with the VLT-VIMOS integral-field spectrograph covering the central 50&amp;quot;x50&amp;quot; of NGC7252 to map the stellar and ionised gas kinematics, and the distribution and conditions of the ionised gas, revealing the extent of ongoing star formation and recent star formation history. We find that the inner gas disc is not counter-rotating with respect to the stars and that the stellar kinematics appear complex with a clear indication of a prolate-like rotation component suggesting a polar merger configuration. The ongoing star formation rate is 2.2+-0.6 M_sun/yr and implies a typical depletion time of 2Gyr given the molecular gas content. Furthermore, the spatially-resolved star formation history suggests a slight radial dependence, moving outwards at later times. We confirm a large AGN-ionised gas cloud previously discovered 5kpc south of the nucleus, and find higher ionisation also at the galaxy centre relative to the surrounding gas disc. Although the higher ionisation towards the centre is potentially degenerate within the central star forming ring, it may be associated with a low-luminosity AGN. Although NGC7252 has been classified as post-starburst galaxy at the centre, the elliptical-like major-merger remnant still appears very active. A central kpc-scale gas disc has presumably re-formed quickly within the last 100Myr after final coalescence. The disc features ongoing star formation, implying Gyr long timescale to reach the red sequence through gas consumption alone. While NGC7252 is useful to probe the transformation from discs to ellipticals, it is not well-suited to study the transformation from blue to red at this point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improving star-galaxy separation with neural networks</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/project/sneppen_stargal/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 10:34:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/project/sneppen_stargal/</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="co-supervised-albert-sneppen-dawn-summer-student-2015">Co-supervised Albert Sneppen, DAWN Summer Student (2015)&lt;/h4>

&lt;p>It is well established that galactic clusters provide dynamic environments in which to examine galaxy evolution. The starbursting dwarf irregular NGC 1427A presents an interesting case as it is being pulled into the nearby Fornax cluster at supersonic speeds, producing a visibly exceptional star formation rate and notably blue colors. It has been suggested that the highly deformed structure of NGC 1427A is due to ram pressure stripping as a result of interacting with a super-heated ICM provided by several nearby elliptical galaxies. The gas density profile of its leading edge is similar to a &amp;ldquo;bow-shock&amp;rdquo;, containing several dozen super-star clusters (SSCs) and thousands of smaller star forming clusters. It is clearly evident that the properties of NGC 1427A change rapidly over relatively short distances. Using dithered HST/ACS images in Sloan equivalent g&amp;rsquo; r&amp;rsquo; i&amp;rsquo; z&amp;rsquo; and Hα filters, we present a morphological and photometric study of NGC 1427A using a novel approach in which stellar properties are measured from sources grouped within localized regions. Apertures are fitted for ~5000 sources at 4σ using a filter-combined master image. Four characteristic regions are chosen to study stellar properties, selected interactively through DS9. We then introduce COMET, a specially-designed source catalog handler for producing graphical figures of each region, cropping both spatially and photometrically. These are then batch-reviewed and analyzed using synthetic isochrones corresponding of each region. Hα bright sources are indicated to illustrate the significance of SSCs. Secondary analysis is carried out using smoothed color maps of source-subtracted diffuse light, yielding penetrative mapping of underlying stellar populations. We show for the first time how the dynamical stellar populations of NGC 1427A differ as a function of position across the surface of the galaxy, ultimately furthering our understanding of cluster interactions and the evolution of irregular galaxies.

&lt;p>With ever increasing capability, we are now able to push galaxy evolution studies to extreme high redshift (z&amp;gt;6). At these early times, the first galaxies begin forming stars but some of their light is quickly absorbed by the neutral intergalactic medium. We utilise the unique multiplexing capacity of slitless grism spectroscopy to explore large samples of candidate systems (6&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;13) using Bayesian techniques to quantify line detections. We present preliminary results of 29 spectroscopic candidates selected for the first time as extreme high redshift galaxies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Intensive observations required to spectroscopically secure such a faint source necessitates a careful evaluation of the photometry from which the redshift prior is based. Photometric data were re-evaluated by examining individual image cutouts to discount erroneous measurements. Of the 29 galaxies, 3 are found to be outright spurious and 17 are advanced as high-confidence candidates for follow-up observation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Farmer</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/project/thefarmer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 10:34:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/project/thefarmer/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Most Massive Galaxies in the Early Universe</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/project/massivequiescent/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 10:34:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/project/massivequiescent/</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="collaboration-with-kate-gould">Collaboration with Kate Gould&lt;/h4></description></item><item><title>Univ. of St Andrews Astronomical Society</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/outreach/societies/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 10:34:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/outreach/societies/</guid><description>&lt;p>The University of St Andrews Astronomical Society (&lt;a href="https://www.astrosoc.club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AstroSoc&lt;/a>) was established in 1972 and has grown into one of the largest student-led astronomical societies world-wide, consisting of over 200 paid members annually.

&lt;p>We present a study of 9258 quasars observed with multi-epoch ugriz photometry with spectroscopic redshifts as part of the SDSS Southern Survey. Using a linear model to fit the spectral variations, we isolate separate spectra for the variable (disc) non-variable(disc + galaxy) components of each quasar. We find evidence for bluer spectral slopes than predicted by cannonical accretion disc theory and excellent agreement with SMC-like dust extinction. This work provides the first direct evidence to support recent groundbreaking theoretical efforts to analytically describe accretion discs in the context of General Relativity and magnetic stress.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beasts in the Bubbles: Measurement of the Massive End of z>8 UV Luminosity Function</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/talk/sazerac2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/talk/sazerac2/</guid><description>&lt;p>The current state-of-the-art observational constraints on the evolution of the most massive and most UV-luminous galaxies at z &amp;gt; 8, and their growth in relation to large-scale structure and reionization, are derived from measurements of the UV Luminosity Function (UV LF).

&lt;p>We propose X-shooter observations for four UV-bright (H=24.5-25.4 mag) novel candidates at z=9-10 from the brand new COSMOS2020 catalogue, now benefitting from homogeneous near-IR and ultra-deep optical coverage. All candidates have clear Lyman-break features, IRAC detection, tight distributions in PDF(z) at z=9-10, the inconsistency with any stellar templates and lower-z galaxy, and are confirmed at z&amp;gt;9 with four independent redshift estimates. The volume density of these four candidates is also consistent with the bright-end of the latest UV luminosity function (UVLF) studies at z=9-10. We will 1) confirm the redshift and the power-law nature of the UVLF at z=9-10; and test if UV-bright galaxies at z=9-10 2) reside in ionized bubbles; and 3) host AGN via the Nv1243 line. Our targets will provide essential constraints on the bright/massive-end of luminosity/mass function at z&amp;gt;9 and the CDM scenario for the formation of early galaxies, once at least one is confirmed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chasing big bubbles: the confirmation of a bright z=9.8 galaxy</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2021_noema_beasts_valentino/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2021_noema_beasts_valentino/</guid><description>&lt;p>NOEMA | 30.0hrs | PI - F. Valentino&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We request 30h of NOEMA/2mm time to spectroscopically confirm the redshift of a novel and robust UV- bright (MUV=-22.9 mag) galaxy candidate at z=9.82 from the new COSMOS2020 catalog. The candidate is massive (log(M/Msun)=10.5), highly star-forming (log(SFR/Msun/yr)=2.2), and shows a tight redshift PDF, which can be covered at 90% with a single NOEMA frequency setting targeting [CII]. These properties suggest a sufficient metal enrichment and encourage the search for this line and its underlying dust continuum emission. If confirmed, this will be a redshift record-breaking discovery, while the [CII] and dust IR luminosity will give us insight into the gas and obscured SFR. This will allow us to explore the SFR or MUV-L[CII] and IRX-beta relations at the unprecedented z~10 regime. This would also support the role of ultra-bright sources to generate large reionization bubbles. The target is 1.5dex more star forming than the only other source confirmed with FIR lines at z=9.11 and it does not suffer from lensing uncertainties. The large bandwidth and arcsec resolution of NOEMA are optimal to carry out this project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COSMOS2020: A panchromatic view of the Universe to z~10</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/talk/aas2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/talk/aas2021/</guid><description>&lt;p>The COSMOS field has proven to be one of the cornerstone surveys in extragalactic astronomy. Since our last public catalog in 2015, a wealth of new imaging and spectroscopic data has been collected in COSMOS. We describe the collection, processing, and analysis of the best available imaging data in COSMOS over 39 bands and produce a new reference photometric redshift catalog. Powerful new constraints are made possible from the ultra-deep optical imaging with Hyper Suprime-Cam, UltraVISTA near-infrared Ks imaging at least 1 magnitude deeper than in 2015, and the inclusion of all Spitzer IRAC infrared imaging ever taken on COSMOS. We find significant improvement in our astrometric reference from 2015 by utilizing Gaia DR1. From this reprocessed data, we perform source detection and photometry for 1 million sources across 2 deg2 of the COSMOS field, using both traditional aperture photometric methods and a new profile-fitting photometric measurement tool we have developed. In addition to a detailed comparison of both methods, we report the achievement of sub-percent accuracy in our derived photometric redshifts at i &amp;lt; 22.5 AB and at 25 &amp;lt; i &amp;lt; 27 of less than 5 per-cent. Encouraged by this result, we present measurements of the deepest wide-field NIR-selected galaxy number counts and discuss several immediate science projects enabled by this work including the galaxy stellar mass and UV luminosity functions as well as constraints on the halo occupation distribution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COSMOS2020: A next-generation catalog to explore the 1 &lt; z &lt; 8 universe</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2021-aas-23721506-w/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2021-aas-23721506-w/</guid><description/></item><item><title>We've been awarded JWST Cycle 1 time!</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/post/jwst/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/post/jwst/</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="see-the-program-information-on-the-space-telescope-science-institutes-websitehttpswwwstsciedujwstscience-executionprogram-informationid2659">See the Program Information on the &lt;a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=2659" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space Telescope Science Institute&amp;rsquo;s Website&lt;/a>&lt;/h4>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We propose restframe UV and optical spectroscopy to confirm redshifts and measure star-formation rates, stellar masses, and dust extinction for the five most luminous galaxies at 9&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;10 over two square degrees of the COSMOS survey. The unique combination of a wide-field near-infrared imaging coupled with new ultra-deep optical and infrared data makes this the most secure sample of 9&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;10 galaxy candidates currently available. However, these objects are too rare to be found by very deep, but smaller surveys with JWST, and the serendipitous discovery of even one such galaxy outside of COSMOS is unlikely from the entirety of planned GTO and ERS programs. These massive, luminous galaxies, seen only 500 million years after the Big Bang, are ideal tracers of the primordial dark matter structures from which they formed and grew. However, their mere existence at these early times challenges the current paradigm of early galaxy formation and evolution. Thus, it is essential to confirm their high redshift nature and reveal the means by which these remarkable cosmic beasts so rapidly built up their stellar mass.&lt;/p>

It is then no surprise that it has played a pivotal role in our understanding of galaxy evolution, especially at early times where sources are too faint to be studied en masse by comparably shallow, wide-field surveys. Now in the decade of groundbreaking optical-NIR facilities such as the Nancy Roman Space Telescope, alongside JWST, LSST, and Euclid, the stage is set to probe deeper into the Universe than ever before. COSMOS is the natural stepping stone in this progressively deeper investigation and has been selected as one of the primary calibration fields for forthcoming surveys. It is for these reasons why we must continue to innovate. We present COSMOS2020, the latest installment of catalogs to map COSMOS, now at unprecedented optical-NIR depths in excess of 28 mags over 2 deg2. A total of 37 bands of photometry are newly extracted for 1M sources using bleeding-edge profile-fitting photometry provided by The Tractor. We find intensely competitive measurements compared to an identical extraction with SExtractor, benchmarked by photometric redshift accuracy below 2% at i &amp;lt; 24. Incredibly, we show that The Tractor provides the incredibly robust high-redshift photometry with remarkably little photometric redshift bias, underscoring the transformative role of profile-fitting photometry in the next generation of galaxy surveys.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Comparison of stellar populations in simulated and real post-starburst galaxies in MaNGA</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2020-mnras-498-1259-z/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2020-mnras-498-1259-z/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The BUFFALO HST Survey</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2020-ap-js-247-64-s/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2020-ap-js-247-64-s/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A Method to Distinguish Quiescent and Dusty Star-forming Galaxies with Machine Learning</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2020-ap-j-891-136-s/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2020-ap-j-891-136-s/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Resolving the rapid quenching of star formation in the local Universe</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2020_alma_psb_rowlands/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 11:15:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2020_alma_psb_rowlands/</guid><description>&lt;p>ALMA | Cycle 7 | 10.7hrs | PI - K.

&lt;p>One key problem in galaxy evolution is how and why galaxies stop forming stars. However, the exact mechanisms that lead to the disruption of the gas supply, the relative importance of different quenching mechanisms, and the timescales involved are still poorly understood. Post-starburst galaxies are an ideal laboratory to study the galaxy transition process as they have undergone a recent, rapid shutdown in star formation, and are expected to be devoid of cold gas. Surprisingly, many of these galaxies still host large reservoirs of molecular gas, which challenges our current picture of quenching. Recent studies of these galaxies suffered from an aperture bias - we know rapid quenching of star formation occured in some regions but we only have unresolved measurements of the molecular gas. We propose to map CO(1-0) emission at 2.5&amp;quot; resolution matched to optical integral field spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey in 13 post-starburst galaxies. We will determine whether a low gas fraction in post-starburst regions is the cause of quenching, or if gas is forming stars inefficiently. Only the combination of ALMA and optical IFU observations can reveal what processes are responsible for stopping star formation in galaxies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Finding High Redshift Galaxies Using the 3D-HST Survey</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2020-aas-23520828-t/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2020-aas-23520828-t/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Improving star-galaxy seperation with neural networks</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2020-aas-23530610-s/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2020-aas-23530610-s/</guid><description/></item><item><title>The Farmer: Improved model-based photometry for the next generation of galaxy surveys</title><link>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2019-amgp-conf-e-9-w/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/2019-amgp-conf-e-9-w/</guid><description/></item><item><title>History and destiny of an emerging early-type galaxy.
