bio: My research interests lie almost exclusively within the realm of
  extragalactic astrophysics and cosmology. I use state-of-the-art optical and
  infrared observatories and surveys to study the lives of galaxies, and how
  their properties change over cosmic time. This includes detailed case studies
  of individual galaxies, as well as statistical analyses of large survey
  catalogs.
interests:
  - Galaxy Evolution
  - The Early Universe
  - Star-formation Cessation
  - Statistical Methods

I am a PhD student based at the [Cosmic Dawn Center](https://cosmicdawn.dk/) advised by Sune Toft, with Peter Capak (fmr. Caltech/IPAC), Henry McCracken (IAP), Bahram Mobasher (UCR), and Dave Sanders (IfA/Hawaii). I received my Masters degree in 2018 from the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) advised by Vivienne Wild. My research focuses on the assembly and evolution of galaxies across the history of the Universe, through direct observation with telescopes from both space and the ground.\
\
I have held internship or visiting positions at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/), the [University of Hawaii](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/), the [Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy](https://www.mpia.de/en), [Leiden Observatory](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/astronomy), and the [Maria Mitchell Observatory](http://www.mariamitchell.org/research-and-collections/astronomy/research). I also led the creation of the spectroscopy database [AVSpec](https://www.aavso.org/apps/avspec/) for the [American Association of Variable Star Observers](https://www.aavso.org/) as a Mayall Fellow.\
\
Beyond academia, I am a frequent contributor to popular science publications including the paper digest [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/author/jweaver/), and have been a long-time volunteer at [public observatories](outreach/observatories/).
