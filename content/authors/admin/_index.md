bio: My research interests lie almost exclusively within the realm of
  extragalactic astrophysics and cosmology. I use state-of-the-art optical and
  infrared observatories and surveys to study the lives of galaxies, and how
  their properties change over cosmic time. This includes detailed case studies
  of individual galaxies, as well as statistical analyses of large survey
  catalogs.
interests:
  - Galaxy Evolution
  - The Early Universe
  - Star-formation Cessation
  - Statistical Methods

I am a Postdoc based at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.astro.umass.edu/) in [Kate Whitaker's Group](https://www.astrowhit.com/). I received my PhD in 2022 from the [Cosmic Dawn Center](https://cosmicdawn.dk/) advised by Sune Toft, and before that my Masters degree in 2018 from the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) advised by Vivienne Wild. My research focuses on the stellar mass assembly of galaxiesand  star-formation cessation in the early universe through direct observation with telescopes from both space and the ground. I am a core member of several collaborations including the Cosmic Dawn Survey (DAWN), Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS), UNCOVER, as well as the Euclid Consortium.\
\
I have held internship or visiting positions at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.ipac.caltech.edu/), the [University of Hawaii](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/), the [Max-Planck Institute for Astronomy](https://www.mpia.de/en), [Leiden Observatory](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/astronomy), and the [Maria Mitchell Observatory](http://www.mariamitchell.org/research-and-collections/astronomy/research). I also led the creation of the spectroscopy database [AVSpec](https://www.aavso.org/apps/avspec/) for the [American Association of Variable Star Observers](https://www.aavso.org/) as a Mayall Fellow.\
\
Beyond academia, I am a frequent contributor to popular science publications including the paper digest [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/author/jweaver/), and have been a long-time volunteer at [public observatories](outreach/observatories/).
