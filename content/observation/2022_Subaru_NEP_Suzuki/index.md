Subaru/HSC | 2N | PI - N. Suzuki

We request 2 nights of Subaru Hyper-SuprimeCam to complete z-band observations of the largest multi-wavelength (ugriz) field, Hawaii Two-0 (H20), a contiguous survey covering 20 sq. deg area of two primary Euclid Deep Calibration Fields (NEP and CDFS). A total of 30 nights on the Subaru/HSC and 10 nights on the Keck/DEIMOS telescopes were allocated for this program through the Hawaii TAC which has now completed g-, r-, i- band coverage. This proposal is to complete the z-band photometric survey in the NEP field to the desired depth of 26.5 AB. The z-band data are essential for accurate physical parameter measurements of galaxies at 0 < z < 3 (e.g., photometric redshift and stellar mass) and selection of galaxies at 3 < z < 6  . These measurements will allow us to study the evolution of massive galaxies to z~6, estimate the properties of their dark matter haloes through clustering measurements, and find rare objects that are re-ionizing the universe. This is a legacy Euclid program.
