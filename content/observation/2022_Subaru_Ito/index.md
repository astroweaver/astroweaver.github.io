Keck/MOSFIRE | 1N | PI - K. Ito

We propose to conduct MOSFIRE spectroscopy for an overdense
region of massive (log M⋆/M⊙>10.5) quiescent galaxies at z= 2.8, which is newly found from the latest COSMOS2020 catalog. Though
many passive galaxies exist in local
galaxy clusters, most known protoclusters are found by only star
-forming galaxies. Protoclusters consisting of quiescent
galaxies had not been found at
z > 2. The high-redshift structures of quiescent galaxies are unique a
nd expected to
provide an insight into the (proto)cluster evolution and the connec
tion between the environment and the quenching. Our
goals of this proposal are 1). to spectroscopically confirm the str
ucture from Balmer absorption lines of 12 quiescent
galaxies therein and 2). to explore their star formation history thr
ough the observed spectrum and plenty of multi-band
photometry data. The derived star formation history will conclude
the primordial environmental effect on the stellar age
and constrain the progenitor of this structure. If this structur
e is spectroscopically confirmed, this is the most distant
protocluster of quiescent galaxies, which will be an ideal laboratory
for conducting the follow-up observation, such as by
ALMA.
