abstract: >
  The current state-of-the-art observational constraints on the evolution of the
  most massive and most UV-luminous galaxies at z > 8, and their growth in
  relation to large-scale structure and reionization, are derived from
  measurements of the UV Luminosity Function (UV LF). Here we present powerful
  new constraints on UV emission from sources contributing to the Epoch of
  Reionization (EoR) at its very onset, at only 500 Myr after the Big Bang. We
  identify these sources with the new COSMOS2020 galaxy catalog, which utilizes
  new ultra-deep optical and near-infrared imaging necessary to securely
  identify candidate galaxies from the EoR, each with four consistent
  measurements of photometric redshift and UV luminosity. Encouraged by this
  unprecedented agreement, we confirm a highly significant departure from the
  expected Schechter Function form of the UV LF seen in the local universe,
  suggesting that galaxy evolution has yet to set in at these early times. An
  already approved JWST Cycle 1 program (PI: Weaver) will target five of the
  most robust and most UV-luminous (MUV ~ -22.5) z~9 galaxies in COSMOS with
  detailed spatially resolved spectroscopy. This ambitious program will
  comprehensively map out not only the UV emission from these galaxies, but also
  their dust attenuation, morphology, and stellar assembly histories. These new
  insights will provide the context necessary to understand the formation of the
  most massive, and UV-luminous galaxies in the EoR.
