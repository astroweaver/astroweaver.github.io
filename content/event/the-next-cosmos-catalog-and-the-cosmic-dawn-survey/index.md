title: The Next COSMOS Catalog and the Cosmic Dawn Survey
abstract: >-
  Since the first glimpses of galaxy evolution by Hubble in 1926, we have made
  tremendous progress in understanding the lives and deaths of galaxies through
  ultra-deep pinpoint surveys. Now on the cusp of the era of extremely large
  telescopes and ambitious space missions such as JWST and Euclid, our
  capabilities in data processing and statistics are being pushed to new limits.
  To prepare, we are reprocessing observations on an industrial scale.


  The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) is no exception. A newly devised method of photometry called “The Tractor” has been shown to both improve photometric redshift estimates by resolving blended infrared sources, and provide statistically sound detections of even fainter galaxies. The next release of COSMOS will combine reprocessed ultra-deep optical and infrared observations with this new photometric method to provide the state-of-the-art galaxy catalog for the immediate future.


  This approach will then be industrialized to process, photometer, and characterize sources within the unprecedented 30sq degree Cosmic Dawn Survey to provide mass-complete studies of galaxy stellar mass and star-formation rates out to z=9. Observations will focus on the forthcoming NEP and CDFS fields which will see deep imaging with Euclid in intermediate bands. Proposed follow-up with the multiplexed Prime Focus Spectrograph will enable definitive studies of the co-evolution of baryonic and dark matter, as well as of the epoch of re-ionization and the first assembly of galaxies.
