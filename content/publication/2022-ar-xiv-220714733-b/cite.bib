 abstract = {Over the last few years, both ALMA and Spitzer/IRAC observations have
revealed a population of likely massive galaxies at $z>3$ that
was too faint to be detected in HST rest-frame ultraviolet
imaging. However, due to the very limited photometry for
individual galaxies, the true nature of these so-called HST-dark
galaxies has remained elusive. Here, we present the first sample
of such galaxies observed with very deep, high-resolution NIRCam
imaging from the Early Release Science Program CEERS. 33 HST-
dark sources are selected based on their red colours across 1.6
$μ$m to 4.4 $μ$m. Their physical properties are derived from
12-band multi-wavelength photometry, including ancillary HST
imaging. We find that these galaxies are generally heavily dust-
obscured ($A_V∼2$ mag), massive ($łog (M/M_ødot)
∼10$), star-forming sources at $z∼2-8$ with an observed
surface density of $∼0.8$ arcmin$^-2$. This suggests that
an important fraction of massive galaxies may have been missing
from our cosmic census at $z>3$ all the way into the
reionization epoch. The HST-dark sources lie on the main-
sequence of galaxies and add an obscured star formation rate
density (SFRD) of $\mathrm1.3^+1.6_-1.0 \times 10^-3
M_ødot/yr/Mpc^3$ at $z∼6$, similar to previous
estimates. Our analysis shows the unique power of JWST to reveal
this previously missing galaxy population and to provide a
complete census of galaxies at $z=2-8$ based on rest-frame
optical imaging.},
