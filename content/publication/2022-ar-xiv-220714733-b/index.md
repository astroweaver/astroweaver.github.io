abstract: Over the last few years, both ALMA and Spitzer/IRAC observations have revealed
  a population of likely massive galaxies at $z>3$ that was too faint to be detected
  in HST rest-frame ultraviolet imaging. However, due to the very limited photometry
  for individual galaxies, the true nature of these so-called HST-dark galaxies has
  remained elusive. Here, we present the first sample of such galaxies observed with
  very deep, high-resolution NIRCam imaging from the Early Release Science Program
  CEERS. 33 HST- dark sources are selected based on their red colours across 1.6 $μ$m
  to 4.4 $μ$m. Their physical properties are derived from 12-band multi-wavelength
  photometry, including ancillary HST imaging. We find that these galaxies are generally
  heavily dust- obscured ($A_V∼2$ mag), massive ($łog (M/M_ødot) ∼10$), star-forming
  sources at $z∼2-8$ with an observed surface density of $∼0.8$ arcmin$^-2$. This
  suggests that an important fraction of massive galaxies may have been missing from
  our cosmic census at $z>3$ all the way into the reionization epoch. The HST-dark
  sources lie on the main- sequence of galaxies and add an obscured star formation
  rate density (SFRD) of $mathrm1.3^+1.6_-1.0 times 10^-3 M_ødot/yr/Mpc^3$ at $z∼6$,
  similar to previous estimates. Our analysis shows the unique power of JWST to reveal
  this previously missing galaxy population and to provide a complete census of galaxies
  at $z=2-8$ based on rest-frame optical imaging.
