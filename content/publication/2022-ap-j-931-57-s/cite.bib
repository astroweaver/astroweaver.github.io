 abstract = {A universal stellar initial mass function (IMF) should not be expected
from theoretical models of star formation, but little conclusive
observational evidence for a variable IMF has been uncovered. In
this paper, a parameterization of the IMF is introduced into
photometric template fitting of the COSMOS2015 catalog. The
resulting best-fit templates suggest systematic variations in
the IMF, with most galaxies exhibiting top-heavier stellar
populations than in the Milky Way. At fixed redshift, only a
small range of IMFs are found, with the typical IMF becoming
progressively top-heavier with increasing redshift.
Additionally, subpopulations of ULIRGs, quiescent and star-
forming galaxies are compared with predictions of stellar
population feedback and show clear qualitative similarities to
the evolution of dust temperatures.},
