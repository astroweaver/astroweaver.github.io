abstract: A universal stellar initial mass function (IMF) should not be expected from
  theoretical models of star formation, but little conclusive observational evidence
  for a variable IMF has been uncovered. In this paper, a parameterization of the
  IMF is introduced into photometric template fitting of the COSMOS2015 catalog. The
  resulting best-fit templates suggest systematic variations in the IMF, with most
  galaxies exhibiting top-heavier stellar populations than in the Milky Way. At fixed
  redshift, only a small range of IMFs are found, with the typical IMF becoming progressively
  top-heavier with increasing redshift. Additionally, subpopulations of ULIRGs, quiescent
  and star- forming galaxies are compared with predictions of stellar population feedback
  and show clear qualitative similarities to the evolution of dust temperatures.
