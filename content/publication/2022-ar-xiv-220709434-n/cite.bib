 abstract = {The first few hundred Myrs at $z>10$ mark the last major uncharted epoch
in the history of the Universe, where only a single galaxy
(GNz11 at $z≈11$) is currently spectroscopically
confirmed. Here we present a search for luminous $z>10$ galaxies
with $JWST$/NIRCam photometry spanning $≈1-5μ$m and
covering 49 arcmin$^2$ from the public $JWST$ Early Release
Science programs (CEERS and GLASS). Our most secure candidates
are two $M_m̊UV≈-21$ systems: GLASS-z13 and
GLASS-z11. These galaxies display abrupt $rsim2.5$ mag breaks in
their spectral energy distributions, consistent with complete
absorption of flux bluewards of Lyman-$α$ that is
redshifted to $z≈13$ and $z≈11$. Lower redshift
interlopers such as dusty quiescent galaxies with strong Balmer
breaks would be comfortably detected at $>5σ$ in multiple
bands where instead we find no flux. From SED modeling we infer
that these galaxies have already built up $∼ 10^9$ solar
masses in stars over the $łesssim300-400$ Myrs after the Big
Bang. The brightness of these sources enable morphological
constraints. Tantalizingly, GLASS-z11 shows a clearly extended
exponential light profile, potentially consistent with a disk
galaxy of $r_\̊50≈0.7$ kpc. These sources, if
confirmed, join GNz11 in defying number density forecasts for
luminous galaxies based on Schechter UV luminosity functions,
which require a survey area $>10\times$ larger than we have
studied here to find such luminous sources at such high
redshifts. They extend evidence from lower redshifts for little
or no evolution in the bright end of the UV luminosity function
into the cosmic dawn epoch, with implications for just how early
these galaxies began forming. This, in turn, suggests that
future deep $JWST$ observations may identify relatively bright
galaxies to much earlier epochs than might have been
anticipated.},
