abstract: 'The first few hundred Myrs at $z>10$ mark the last major uncharted epoch
  in the history of the Universe, where only a single galaxy (GNz11 at $z≈11$) is
  currently spectroscopically confirmed. Here we present a search for luminous $z>10$
  galaxies with $JWST$/NIRCam photometry spanning $≈1-5μ$m and covering 49 arcmin$^2$
  from the public $JWST$ Early Release Science programs (CEERS and GLASS). Our most
  secure candidates are two $M_m̊UV≈-21$ systems: GLASS-z13 and GLASS-z11. These galaxies
  display abrupt $rsim2.5$ mag breaks in their spectral energy distributions, consistent
  with complete absorption of flux bluewards of Lyman-$α$ that is redshifted to $z≈13$
  and $z≈11$. Lower redshift interlopers such as dusty quiescent galaxies with strong
  Balmer breaks would be comfortably detected at $>5σ$ in multiple bands where instead
  we find no flux. From SED modeling we infer that these galaxies have already built
  up $∼ 10^9$ solar masses in stars over the $łesssim300-400$ Myrs after the Big Bang.
  The brightness of these sources enable morphological constraints. Tantalizingly,
  GLASS-z11 shows a clearly extended exponential light profile, potentially consistent
  with a disk galaxy of $r_̊50≈0.7$ kpc. These sources, if confirmed, join GNz11 in
  defying number density forecasts for luminous galaxies based on Schechter UV luminosity
  functions, which require a survey area $>10times$ larger than we have studied here
  to find such luminous sources at such high redshifts. They extend evidence from
  lower redshifts for little or no evolution in the bright end of the UV luminosity
  function into the cosmic dawn epoch, with implications for just how early these
  galaxies began forming. This, in turn, suggests that future deep $JWST$ observations
  may identify relatively bright galaxies to much earlier epochs than might have been
  anticipated.'
