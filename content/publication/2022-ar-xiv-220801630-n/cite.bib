 abstract = {With just a month of data, JWST is already transforming our view of the
Universe, revealing and resolving starlight in unprecedented
populations of galaxies. Although ``HST-dark'' galaxies have
previously been detected at long wavelengths, these observations
generally suffer from a lack of spatial resolution which limits
our ability to characterize their sizes and morphologies. Here
we report on a first view of starlight from a subset of the HST-
dark population that are bright with JWST/NIRCam
(4.4$μ$m<24.5mag) and very faint or even invisible with HST
($<$1.6$μ$m). In this Letter we focus on a dramatic and
unanticipated population of physically extended galaxies
($rsim$0.17''). These 12 galaxies have photometric redshifts
$2<z<6$, high stellar masses $M_⋆rsim 10^10~M_ødot$,
and significant dust-attenuated star formation. Surprisingly,
the galaxies have elongated projected axis ratios at 4.4$μ$m,
suggesting that the population is disk-dominated or prolate.
Most of the galaxies appear red at all radii, suggesting
significant dust attenuation throughout. We refer to these red,
disky, HST-dark galaxies as Ultra-red Flattened Objects (UFOs).
With $r_e$(F444W)$∼1-2$åisebox-0.5ex~kpc,
the galaxies are similar in size to compact massive galaxies at
$z∼2$ and the cores of massive galaxies and S0s at $z∼0$.
The stellar masses, sizes, and morphologies of the sample
suggest that some could be progenitors of lenticular or fast-
rotating galaxies in the local Universe. The existence of this
population suggests that our previous censuses of the universe
may have missed massive, dusty edge-on disks, in addition to
dust-obscured starbursts.},
