abstract: The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) has become a cornerstone of extragalactic
  astronomy. Since the last public catalog in 2015, a wealth of new imaging and spectroscopic
  data have been collected in the COSMOS field. This paper describes the collection,
  processing, and analysis of these new imaging data to produce a new reference photometric
  redshift catalog. Source detection and multiwavelength photometry are performed
  for 1.7 million sources across the 2 deg$^2$ of the COSMOS field, åisebox-0.5ex~966,000
  of which are measured with all available broadband data using both traditional aperture
  photometric methods and a new profile-fitting photometric extraction tool, THE FARMER,
  which we have developed. A detailed comparison of the two resulting photometric
  catalogs is presented. Photometric redshifts are computed for all sources in each
  catalog utilizing two independent photometric redshift codes. Finally, a comparison
  is made between the performance of the photometric methodologies and of the redshift
  codes to demonstrate an exceptional degree of self-consistency in the resulting
  photometric redshifts. The i < 21 sources have subpercent photometric redshift accuracy
  and even the faintest sources at 25 < i < 27 reach a precision of 5%. Finally, these
  results are discussed in the context of previous, current, and future surveys in
  the COSMOS field. Compared to COSMOS2015, it reaches the same photometric redshift
  precision at almost one magnitude deeper. Both photometric catalogs and their photometric
  redshift solutions and physical parameters will be made available through the usual
  astronomical archive systems (ESO Phase 3, IPAC-IRSA, and CDS).
