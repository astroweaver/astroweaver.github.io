 abstract = {The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) has become a cornerstone of
extragalactic astronomy. Since the last public catalog in 2015,
a wealth of new imaging and spectroscopic data have been
collected in the COSMOS field. This paper describes the
collection, processing, and analysis of these new imaging data
to produce a new reference photometric redshift catalog. Source
detection and multiwavelength photometry are performed for 1.7
million sources across the 2 deg$^2$ of the COSMOS field,
åisebox-0.5ex~966,000 of which are measured
with all available broadband data using both traditional
aperture photometric methods and a new profile-fitting
photometric extraction tool, THE FARMER, which we have
developed. A detailed comparison of the two resulting
photometric catalogs is presented. Photometric redshifts are
computed for all sources in each catalog utilizing two
independent photometric redshift codes. Finally, a comparison is
made between the performance of the photometric methodologies
and of the redshift codes to demonstrate an exceptional degree
of self-consistency in the resulting photometric redshifts. The
i < 21 sources have subpercent photometric redshift accuracy and
even the faintest sources at 25 < i < 27 reach a precision of
5%. Finally, these results are discussed in the context of
previous, current, and future surveys in the COSMOS field.
Compared to COSMOS2015, it reaches the same photometric redshift
precision at almost one magnitude deeper. Both photometric
catalogs and their photometric redshift solutions and physical
parameters will be made available through the usual astronomical
archive systems (ESO Phase 3, IPAC-IRSA, and CDS).},
