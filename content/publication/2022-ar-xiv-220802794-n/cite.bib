 abstract = {$JWST$'s first glimpse of the $z>10$ Universe has yielded a surprising
abundance of luminous galaxy candidates. Here we present the
most extreme of these systems: CEERS-1749. Based on $0.6-5μ$m
photometry, this strikingly luminous ($≈$26 mag) galaxy
appears to lie at $z≈17$. This would make it an
$M_m̊UV≈-22$,
$M_\̊⋆≈5\times10^9M_\rø̊dot$ system that
formed a mere $∼220$ Myrs after the Big Bang. The implied
number density of this galaxy and its analogues challenges
virtually every early galaxy evolution model that assumes
$Łambda$CDM cosmology. However, there is strong environmental
evidence supporting a secondary redshift solution of
$z≈5$: all three of the galaxy's nearest neighbors at
$<2.5$'' have photometric redshifts of $z≈5$. Further, we
show that CEERS-1749 may lie in a $z≈5$ protocluster that
is $rsim5\times$ overdense compared to the field. Intense line
emission at $z≈5$ from a quiescent galaxy harboring
ionized gas, or from a dusty starburst, may provide satisfactory
explanations for CEERS-1749's photometry. The emission lines at
$z≈5$ conspire to boost the $>2μ$m photometry, producing
an apparent blue slope as well as a strong break in the SED.
Such a perfectly disguised contaminant is possible only in a
narrow redshift window ($Δ złesssim0.1$), implying that
the permitted volume for such interlopers may not be a major
concern for $z>10$ searches, particularly when medium-bands are
deployed. If CEERS-1749 is confirmed to lie at $z≈5$, it
will be the highest-redshift quiescent galaxy, or one of the
lowest mass dusty galaxies of the early Universe detected to-
date. Both redshift solutions of this intriguing galaxy hold the
potential to challenge existing models of early galaxy
evolution, making spectroscopic follow-up of this source
critical.},
