abstract: "$JWST$'s first glimpse of the $z>10$ Universe has yielded a surprising\
  \ abundance of luminous galaxy candidates. Here we present the most extreme of these\
  \ systems: CEERS-1749. Based on $0.6-5μ$m photometry, this strikingly luminous ($≈$26\
  \ mag) galaxy appears to lie at $z≈17$. This would make it an $M_m̊UV≈-22$, $M_̊⋆≈5times10^9M_rø̊dot$\
  \ system that formed a mere $∼220$ Myrs after the Big Bang. The implied number density\
  \ of this galaxy and its analogues challenges virtually every early galaxy evolution\
  \ model that assumes $Łambda$CDM cosmology. However, there is strong environmental\
  \ evidence supporting a secondary redshift solution of $z≈5$: all three of the galaxy's\
  \ nearest neighbors at $<2.5$'' have photometric redshifts of $z≈5$. Further, we\
  \ show that CEERS-1749 may lie in a $z≈5$ protocluster that is $rsim5times$ overdense\
  \ compared to the field. Intense line emission at $z≈5$ from a quiescent galaxy\
  \ harboring ionized gas, or from a dusty starburst, may provide satisfactory explanations\
  \ for CEERS-1749's photometry. The emission lines at $z≈5$ conspire to boost the\
  \ $>2μ$m photometry, producing an apparent blue slope as well as a strong break\
  \ in the SED. Such a perfectly disguised contaminant is possible only in a narrow\
  \ redshift window ($Δ złesssim0.1$), implying that the permitted volume for such\
  \ interlopers may not be a major concern for $z>10$ searches, particularly when\
  \ medium-bands are deployed. If CEERS-1749 is confirmed to lie at $z≈5$, it will\
  \ be the highest-redshift quiescent galaxy, or one of the lowest mass dusty galaxies\
  \ of the early Universe detected to- date. Both redshift solutions of this intriguing\
  \ galaxy hold the potential to challenge existing models of early galaxy evolution,\
  \ making spectroscopic follow-up of this source critical."
