abstract: 'We used the COSMOS2020 catalog to measure the stellar-to-halo mass relation
  (SHMR) divided by central and satellite galaxies from z = 0.2 to z = 5.5. Starting
  from accurate photometric redshifts, we measured the near-infrared selected two-point
  angular correlation and stellar mass functions in ten redshift bins. We used a phenomenological
  model that parametrizes the stellar-to- halo mass relation for central galaxies
  and the number of galaxies inside each halo to describe our observations. This model
  qualitatively reproduces our measurements and their dependence on the stellar mass
  threshold. Surprisingly, the mean halo occupation distribution only shows a mild
  evolution with redshift suggesting that galaxies occupy halos similarly throughout
  cosmic time. At each redshift, we measured the ratio of stellar mass to halo mass,
  M$_*$/M$_h$, which shows the characteristic strong dependence of halo mass with
  a peak at M$_h$$^peak$ ensuremath∼ 2 × 10$^12$ M$_ensuremathødot$. For the first
  time, using a joint modeling of clustering and abundances, we measured the evolution
  of M$_h$$^peak$ from z = 0.2 to z = 5.5. M$_h$$^peak$ increases gradually with redshift
  from log M$_h$$^peak$/M$_ensuremathødot$ ensuremath∼ 12.1 at z ensuremath∼ 0.3 to
  log M$_h$$^peak$/M$_ensuremathødot$ ensuremath∼ 12.3 at z ensuremath∼ 2, and up
  to log M$_h$$^peak$/M$_ensuremathødot$ ensuremath∼ 12.9 at z ensuremath∼ 5. Similarly,
  the stellar mass peak M$_ensuremath*$$^peak$ increases with redshift from log M$_ensuremath*$$^peak$/M$_ensuremathødot$
  ensuremath∼ 10.5 at z ensuremath∼ 0.3 to log M$_ensuremath*$$^peak$/M$_ensuremathødot$
  ensuremath∼ 10.9 at z ensuremath∼ 3. The SHMR ratio at the peak halo mass remains
  almost constant with redshift. These results are in accordance with the scenario
  in which the peak of star-formation efficiency moves toward more massive halos at
  higher redshifts. We also measured the fraction of satellites as a function of stellar
  mass and redshift. For all stellar mass thresholds, the satellite fraction decreases
  at higher redshifts. At a given redshift, there is a higher fraction of low-mass
  satellites and this fraction reaches a plateau at ensuremath∼25% at z ensuremath∼
  1. The satellite contribution to the total stellar mass budget in halos becomes
  more important than that of the central at halo masses of about M$_h$ > 10$^13$
  M$_ensuremathødot$ and always stays below the peak, indicating that quenching mechanisms
  are present in massive halos that keep the star- formation efficiency low. Finally,
  we compared our results with three hydrodynamical simulations: HORIZON-AGN, TNG100
  of the ILLUSTRISTNG project, and EAGLE. We find that the most significant discrepancy
  is at the high-mass end, where the simulations generally show that satellites have
  a higher contribution to the total stellar mass budget than the observations. This,
  together with the finding that the fraction of satellites is higher in the simulations,
  indicates that the feedback mechanisms acting in both group- and cluster-scale halos
  appear to be less efficient in quenching the mass assembly of satellites - and that
  quenching occurs much later in the simulations.'
