 abstract = {This paper presents a new search for \$z≥7.5\$ galaxies
using the COSMOS2020 photometric catalogues. Finding galaxies at
the reionization epoch through deep imaging surveys remains
observationally challenging. The larger area covered by ground-
based surveys like COSMOS enables the discovery of the brightest
galaxies at these high redshifts. Covering \$1.4\$deg\$2̂\$,
our COSMOS catalogues were constructed from the latest
UltraVISTA data release (DR4) combined with the final
Spitzer/IRAC COSMOS images and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Subaru
Strategic Program DR2 release. We identify \$17\$ new
\$7.5<z<10\$ candidate sources, and confirm \$15\$ previously
published candidates. Using deblended photometry extracted by
fitting surface brightness models on multi-band images, we
select four candidates which would be rejected using fixed
aperture photometry. We test the robustness of all our
candidates by comparing six different photometric redshift
estimates. Finally, we compute the galaxy UV luminosity function
in three redshift bins centred at \$z=8,9,10\$. We find no clear
evolution of the number density of the brightest galaxies
\$M_\text\UV\<-21.5\$, in agreement with
previous works. Rapid changes in the quenching efficiency or
attenuation by dust could explain such lack of evolution between
\$z∼ 8\$ and \$z∼ 9. A
spectroscopic confirmation of the redshifts, already planned
with JWST and the Keck telescopes, will be essential to confirm
our results.},
