abstract: This paper presents a new search for $z≥7.5$ galaxies using the COSMOS2020
  photometric catalogues. Finding galaxies at the reionization epoch through deep
  imaging surveys remains observationally challenging. The larger area covered by
  ground- based surveys like COSMOS enables the discovery of the brightest galaxies
  at these high redshifts. Covering $1.4$deg$2̂$, our COSMOS catalogues were constructed
  from the latest UltraVISTA data release (DR4) combined with the final Spitzer/IRAC
  COSMOS images and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program DR2 release. We
  identify $17$ new $7.5<z<10$ candidate sources, and confirm $15$ previously published
  candidates. Using deblended photometry extracted by fitting surface brightness models
  on multi-band images, we select four candidates which would be rejected using fixed
  aperture photometry. We test the robustness of all our candidates by comparing six
  different photometric redshift estimates. Finally, we compute the galaxy UV luminosity
  function in three redshift bins centred at $z=8,9,10$. We find no clear evolution
  of the number density of the brightest galaxies $M_textUV<-21.5$, in agreement with
  previous works. Rapid changes in the quenching efficiency or attenuation by dust
  could explain such lack of evolution between $z∼ 8$ and $z∼ 9. A spectroscopic confirmation
  of the redshifts, already planned with JWST and the Keck telescopes, will be essential
  to confirm our results.
