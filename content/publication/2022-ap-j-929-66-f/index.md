abstract: The faint-end slope of the quasar luminosity function at z åisebox-0.5ex~
  6 and its implication on the role of quasars in reionizing the intergalactic medium
  at early times has been an outstanding problem for some time. The identification
  of faint high-redshift quasars with luminosities of <10$^44.5$ erg s$^-1$ is challenging.
  They are rare (few per square degree), and the separation of these unresolved quasars
  from late-type stars and compact star-forming galaxies is difficult from ground-based
  observations alone. In addition, source confusion becomes significant at >25 mag,
  with i̊sebox-0.5ex~30% of sources having their flux contaminated by foreground objects
  when the seeing resolution is rs̊ebox-0.5ex~0″.7. We mitigate these issues by performing
  a pixel-level joint processing of ground and space-based data from Subaru/Hyper-SuprimeCam
  (HSC) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). We create
  a deconfused catalog over the 1.64 deg$^2$ of the COSMOS field, after accounting
  for spatial varying point- spread functions and astrometric differences between
  the two data sets. We identify twelve low-luminosity (M $_ UV $ rae̊box-0.5ex~ -21
  mag) z > 6 quasar candidates through (i) their red color measured between ACS/F814W
  and HSC/i band and (ii) their compactness in the space-based data. Nondetections
  of our candidates in Hubble DASH data argues against contamination from late-type
  stars. Our constraints on the faint end of the quasar luminosity function at z raib̊ox-0.5ex~
  6.4 suggest a negligibly small contribution to reionization compared to the star-forming
  galaxy population. The confirmation of our candidates and the evolution of number
  density with redshift could provide better insights into how supermassive galaxies
  grew in the first billion years of cosmic time.
