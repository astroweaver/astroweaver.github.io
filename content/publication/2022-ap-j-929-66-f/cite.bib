 abstract = {The faint-end slope of the quasar luminosity function at z
åisebox-0.5ex~ 6 and its implication on the
role of quasars in reionizing the intergalactic medium at early
times has been an outstanding problem for some time. The
identification of faint high-redshift quasars with luminosities
of <10$^44.5$ erg s$^-1$ is challenging. They are rare (few
per square degree), and the separation of these unresolved
quasars from late-type stars and compact star-forming galaxies
is difficult from ground-based observations alone. In addition,
source confusion becomes significant at >25 mag, with
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~30% of sources having their
flux contaminated by foreground objects when the seeing
resolution is \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~0″.7. We mitigate
these issues by performing a pixel-level joint processing of
ground and space-based data from Subaru/Hyper-SuprimeCam (HSC)
and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys
(ACS). We create a deconfused catalog over the 1.64 deg$^2$ of
the COSMOS field, after accounting for spatial varying point-
spread functions and astrometric differences between the two
data sets. We identify twelve low-luminosity (M $_ UV $
\rae̊box-0.5ex~ -21 mag) z > 6 quasar
candidates through (i) their red color measured between
ACS/F814W and HSC/i band and (ii) their compactness in the
space-based data. Nondetections of our candidates in Hubble DASH
data argues against contamination from late-type stars. Our
constraints on the faint end of the quasar luminosity function
at z \raib̊ox-0.5ex~ 6.4 suggest a negligibly
small contribution to reionization compared to the star-forming
galaxy population. The confirmation of our candidates and the
evolution of number density with redshift could provide better
insights into how supermassive galaxies grew in the first
billion years of cosmic time.},
