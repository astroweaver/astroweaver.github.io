 abstract = {We present the characteristics of 2 mm selected sources from the largest
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) blank-field
contiguous survey conducted to date, the Mapping Obscuration to
Reionization with ALMA (MORA) survey covering 184 arcmin$^2$
at 2 mm. Twelve of 13 detections above 5\ensuremathσ
are attributed to emission from galaxies, 11 of which are
dominated by cold dust emission. These sources have a median
redshift of $łangle z_2\,\mathrmmmångle
=3.6_-0.3^+0.4$ primarily based on optical/near-infrared
photometric redshifts with some spectroscopic redshifts, with
77% \ensuremath± 11% of sources at z > 3 and 38%
\ensuremath± 12% of sources at z > 4. This implies that 2
mm selection is an efficient method for identifying the highest-
redshift dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). Lower-redshift
DSFGs (z < 3) are far more numerous than those at z > 3 yet are
likely to drop out at 2 mm. MORA shows that DSFGs with star
formation rates in excess of 300 M $_\ensuremathødot$
yr$^-1$ and a relative rarity of
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^-5$ Mpc$^-3$ contribute
\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~30% to the integrated star
formation rate density at 3 < z < 6. The volume density of 2 mm
selected DSFGs is consistent with predictions from some
cosmological simulations and is similar to the volume density of
their hypothesized descendants: massive, quiescent galaxies at z
> 2. Analysis of MORA sources' spectral energy distributions
hint at steeper empirically measured dust emissivity indices
than reported in typical literature studies, with $łangle β
\ral̊e =2.2_-0.4^+0.5$ . The MORA survey represents an
important step in taking census of obscured star formation in
the universe's first few billion years, but larger area 2 mm
surveys are needed to more fully characterize this rare
population and push to the detection of the universe's first
dusty galaxies.},
