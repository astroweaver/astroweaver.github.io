 abstract = {Large photometric surveys provide a rich source of observations of
quiescent galaxies, including a surprisingly large population at
z > 1. However, identifying large, but clean, samples of
quiescent galaxies has proven difficult because of their near-
degeneracy with interlopers such as dusty, star-forming
galaxies. We describe a new technique for selecting quiescent
galaxies based upon t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
(t-SNE), an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm for
dimensionality reduction. This t-SNE selection provides an
improvement both over UVJ, removing interlopers that otherwise
would pass color selection, and over photometric template
fitting, more strongly toward high redshift. Due to the
similarity between the colors of high- and low-redshift
quiescent galaxies, under our assumptions, t-SNE outperforms
template fitting in 63% of trials at redshifts where a large
training sample already exists. It also may be able to select
quiescent galaxies more efficiently at higher redshifts than the
training sample.},
