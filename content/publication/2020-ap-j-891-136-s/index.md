abstract: Large photometric surveys provide a rich source of observations of quiescent
  galaxies, including a surprisingly large population at z > 1. However, identifying
  large, but clean, samples of quiescent galaxies has proven difficult because of
  their near- degeneracy with interlopers such as dusty, star-forming galaxies. We
  describe a new technique for selecting quiescent galaxies based upon t-distributed
  stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm
  for dimensionality reduction. This t-SNE selection provides an improvement both
  over UVJ, removing interlopers that otherwise would pass color selection, and over
  photometric template fitting, more strongly toward high redshift. Due to the similarity
  between the colors of high- and low-redshift quiescent galaxies, under our assumptions,
  t-SNE outperforms template fitting in 63% of trials at redshifts where a large training
  sample already exists. It also may be able to select quiescent galaxies more efficiently
  at higher redshifts than the training sample.
