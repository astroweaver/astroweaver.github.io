abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is predicted to depend upon the
  temperature of gas in star-forming molecular clouds. The introduction of an additional
  parameter, T $_IMF$, into photometric template fitting suggests most galaxies obey
  an IMF top heavier than the Galactic IMF. The implications of the revised fit on
  mass function, quiescence, and turnoff are discussed. At all redshifts, the highest-mass
  galaxies become quiescent first with the turnoff mass decreasing toward the present.
  The synchronous turnoff mass across galaxies suggests quiescence is driven by universal
  mechanisms rather than by stochastic or environmental processes.
