 abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is predicted to depend upon the
temperature of gas in star-forming molecular clouds. The
introduction of an additional parameter, T $_IMF$, into
photometric template fitting suggests most galaxies obey an IMF
top heavier than the Galactic IMF. The implications of the
revised fit on mass function, quiescence, and turnoff are
discussed. At all redshifts, the highest-mass galaxies become
quiescent first with the turnoff mass decreasing toward the
present. The synchronous turnoff mass across galaxies suggests
quiescence is driven by universal mechanisms rather than by
stochastic or environmental processes.},
