 abstract = {We present a novel method for estimating galaxy physical properties from
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) as an alternative to
template fitting techniques and based on self-organizing maps
(SOMs) to learn the high-dimensional manifold of a photometric
galaxy catalog. The method has previously been tested with
hydrodynamical simulations in Davidzon et al. (2019, MNRAS, 489,
4817), however, here it is applied to real data for the first
time. It is crucial for its implementation to build the SOM with
a high-quality panchromatic data set, thus we selected
``COSMOS2020'' galaxy catalog for this purpose. After the
training and calibration steps with COSMOS2020, other galaxies
can be processed through SOMs to obtain an estimate of their
stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). Both quantities
resulted in a good agreement with independent measurements
derived from more extended photometric baseline and, in
addition, their combination (i.e., the SFR vs. stellar mass
diagram) shows a main sequence of star-forming galaxies that is
consistent with the findings of previous studies. We discuss the
advantages of this method compared to traditional SED fitting,
highlighting the impact of replacing the usual synthetic
templates with a collection of empirical SEDs built by the SOM
in a ``data-driven'' way. Such an approach also allows, even for
extremely large data sets, for an efficient visual inspection to
identify photometric errors or peculiar galaxy types. While also
considering the computational speed of this new estimator, we
argue that it will play a valuable role in the analysis of
oncoming large-area surveys such as Euclid of the Legacy Survey
of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Telescope.},
