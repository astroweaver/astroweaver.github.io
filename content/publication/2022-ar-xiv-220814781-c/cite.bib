 abstract = {We present a new method based on information theory to find the optimal
number of bands required to measure the physical properties of
galaxies with a desired accuracy. As a proof of concept, using
the recently updated COSMOS catalog (COSMOS2020), we identify
the most relevant wavebands for measuring the physical
properties of galaxies in a Hawaii Two-0 (H20)- and UVISTA-like
survey for a sample of $i<25$ AB mag galaxies. We find that with
available $i$-band fluxes, $r$, $u$, IRAC/$ch2$ and $z$ bands
provide most of the information regarding the redshift with
importance decreasing from $r$-band to $z$-band. We also find
that for the same sample, IRAC/$ch2$, $Y$, $r$ and $u$ bands are
the most relevant bands in stellar mass measurements with
decreasing order of importance. Investigating the inter-
correlation between the bands, we train a model to predict
UVISTA observations in near-IR from H20-like observations. We
find that magnitudes in $YJH$ bands can be simulated/predicted
with an accuracy of $1σ$ mag scatter $łesssim 0.2$ for
galaxies brighter than 24 AB mag in near-IR bands. One should
note that these conclusions depend on the selection criteria of
the sample. For any new sample of galaxies with a different
selection, these results should be remeasured. Our results
suggest that in the presence of a limited number of bands, a
machine learning model trained over the population of observed
galaxies with extensive spectral coverage outperforms template-
fitting. Such a machine learning model maximally comprises the
information acquired over available extensive surveys and breaks
degeneracies in the parameter space of template-fitting
inevitable in the presence of a few bands.},
