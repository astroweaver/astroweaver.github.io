abstract: Recent integral field spectroscopic (IFS) surveys have revealed radial gradients
  in the optical spectral indices of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies, which can be used
  to constrain their formation histories. We study the spectral indices of post-processed
  mock IFS datacubes of binary merger simulations, carefully matched to the properties
  of the MaNGA IFS survey, with a variety of black hole (BH) feedback models, progenitor
  galaxies, orbits, and mass ratios. Based on our simulation sample, we find that
  only major mergers on prograde-prograde or retrograde-prograde orbits in combination
  with a mechanical BH feedback model can form galaxies with weak enough ongoing star
  formation, and therefore absent H ensuremathα emission, to be selected by traditional
  PSB selection methods. We find strong fluctuations in nebular emission line strengths,
  even within the PSB phase, suggesting that H ensuremathα selected PSBs are only
  a subsample of the underlying population. The global PSB population can be more
  robustly identified using stellar continuum-based approaches. The difficulty in
  reproducing the very young PSBs in simulations potentially indicates that new sub-resolution
  star formation recipes are required to properly model the process of star formation
  quenching. In our simulations, we find that the starburst peaks at the same time
  at all radii, but is stronger and more prolonged in the inner regions. This results
  in a strong time evolution in the radial gradients of the spectral indices that
  can be used to estimate the age of the starburst without reliance on detailed star
  formation histories from spectral synthesis models.
