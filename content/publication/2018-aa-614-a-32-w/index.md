abstract: "Context. The merging of galaxies is one key aspect in our favourite hierarchical\
  \ ensuremathŁambdaCDM Universe and is an important channel leading to massive quiescent\
  \ elliptical galaxies. Understanding this complex transformational process is ongoing.\
  \  Aims: We aim to study NGC 7252, which is one of the nearest major-merger galaxy\
  \ remnants, observed 1 Gyr after the collision of presumably two gas-rich disc galaxies.\
  \ It is therefore an ideal laboratory to study the processes inherent to the transformation\
  \ of disc galaxies to ellipticals.  Methods: We obtained wide-field IFU spectroscopy\
  \ with the VLT-VIMOS integral-field spectrograph covering the central 50`` × 50''\
  \ of NGC 7252 to map the stellar and ionised gas kinematics, and the distribution\
  \ and conditions of the ionised gas, revealing the extent of ongoing star formation\
  \ and recent star formation history.  Results: Contrary to previous studies, we\
  \ find the inner gas disc not to be counter-rotating with respect to the stars.\
  \ In addition, the stellar kinematics appear complex with a clear indication of\
  \ a prolate-like rotation component which suggests a polar merger configuration.\
  \ The ongoing star formation rate is 2.2 ensuremath± 0.6 M$_ensuremathødot$ yr$^-1$\
  \ and implies a typical depletion time of 2 Gyr given the molecular gas content.\
  \ Furthermore, the spatially resolved star formation history suggests a slight radial\
  \ dependence, moving outwards at later times. We confirm a large AGN-ionised gas\
  \ cloud previously discovered 5 kpc south of the nucleus, and find a higher ionisation\
  \ state of the ionised gas at the galaxy centre relative to the surrounding gas\
  \ disc. Although the higher ionisation towards the centre is potentially degenerate\
  \ within the central star forming ring, it may be associated with a low- luminosity\
  \ AGN.  Conclusions: Although NGC 7252 has been classified as post-starburst galaxy\
  \ at the centre, the elliptical-like major-merger remnant still appears very active.\
  \ A central kpc-scale gas disc has presumably re-formed quickly within the last\
  \ 100 Myr after final coalescence. The disc features ongoing star formation, implying\
  \ Gyr long timescale to reach the red sequence through gas consumption alone. While\
  \ NGC 7252 is useful to probe the transformation from discs to ellipticals, it is\
  \ not well-suited to study the transformation from blue to red at this point."
