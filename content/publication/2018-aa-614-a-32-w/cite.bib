 abstract = {Context. The merging of galaxies is one key aspect in our favourite
hierarchical \ensuremathŁambdaCDM Universe and is an
important channel leading to massive quiescent elliptical
galaxies. Understanding this complex transformational process is
ongoing. \ Aims: We aim to study NGC 7252, which is
one of the nearest major-merger galaxy remnants, observed 1 Gyr
after the collision of presumably two gas-rich disc galaxies. It
is therefore an ideal laboratory to study the processes inherent
to the transformation of disc galaxies to ellipticals.
\ Methods: We obtained wide-field IFU spectroscopy
with the VLT-VIMOS integral-field spectrograph covering the
central 50`` × 50'' of NGC 7252 to map the stellar
and ionised gas kinematics, and the distribution and conditions
of the ionised gas, revealing the extent of ongoing star
formation and recent star formation history. \
Results: Contrary to previous studies, we find the inner gas
disc not to be counter-rotating with respect to the stars. In
addition, the stellar kinematics appear complex with a clear
indication of a prolate-like rotation component which suggests a
polar merger configuration. The ongoing star formation rate is
2.2 \ensuremath± 0.6 M$_\ensuremathødot$ yr$^-1$
and implies a typical depletion time of 2 Gyr given the
molecular gas content. Furthermore, the spatially resolved star
formation history suggests a slight radial dependence, moving
outwards at later times. We confirm a large AGN-ionised gas
cloud previously discovered 5 kpc south of the nucleus, and find
a higher ionisation state of the ionised gas at the galaxy
centre relative to the surrounding gas disc. Although the higher
ionisation towards the centre is potentially degenerate within
the central star forming ring, it may be associated with a low-
luminosity AGN. \ Conclusions: Although NGC 7252
has been classified as post-starburst galaxy at the centre, the
elliptical-like major-merger remnant still appears very active.
A central kpc-scale gas disc has presumably re-formed quickly
within the last 100 Myr after final coalescence. The disc
features ongoing star formation, implying Gyr long timescale to
reach the red sequence through gas consumption alone. While NGC
7252 is useful to probe the transformation from discs to
ellipticals, it is not well-suited to study the transformation
from blue to red at this point.},
