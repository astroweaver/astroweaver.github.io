abstract: "Galaxy sizes and their evolution over cosmic time have been studied for\
  \ decades and serve as key tests of galaxy formation models. However, at z ensuremathgtrsim\
  \ 1 these studies have been limited by a lack of deep, high-resolution rest-frame\
  \ infrared imaging that accurately traces stellar mass distributions. Here, we leverage\
  \ the new capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the 4.4\
  \ ensuremathμm sizes of åisebox-0.5ex~1000 galaxies with $mathrmlogM_* /M_ødot ≥slant\
  \ 9$ and 1.0 ensuremathłeq z ensuremathłeq 2.5 from public CEERS imaging in the\
  \ Extended Groth Strip deep field. We compare the sizes of galaxies measured from\
  \ NIRCam imaging at 4.4 ensuremathμm (ensuremathłambda $_rest$ i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 1.6\
  \ ensuremathμm) with sizes measured at 1.5 ensuremathμm (ensuremathłambda $_rest$\
  \ rs̊ebox-0.5ex~ 5500 r̊). We find that, on average, galaxy half-light radii are\
  \ raib̊ox-0.5ex~9% smaller at 4.4 ensuremathμm than 1.5 ensuremathμm in this sample.\
  \ This size difference is markedly stronger at higher stellar masses and redder\
  \ rest-frame V - J colors: galaxies with M $_*$ raiso̊x-0.5ex~ 10$^11$ M $_ensuremathødot$\
  \ have 4.4 ensuremathμm sizes that are raisex̊-0.5ex~30% smaller than their 1.5\
  \ ensuremathμm sizes. Our results indicate that galaxy mass profiles are significantly\
  \ more compact than their rest- frame optical light profiles at cosmic noon, and\
  \ demonstrate that spatial variations in age and attenuation are important, particularly\
  \ for massive galaxies. The trend we find here impacts our understanding of the\
  \ size growth and evolution of galaxies, and suggests that previous studies based\
  \ on rest-frame optical light may not have captured the mass-weighted structural\
  \ evolution of galaxies. This paper represents a first step toward a new understanding\
  \ of the morphologies of early massive galaxies enabled by JWST's infrared window\
  \ into the distant universe."
