 abstract = {Galaxy sizes and their evolution over cosmic time have been studied for
decades and serve as key tests of galaxy formation models.
However, at z \ensuremath\gtrsim 1 these studies have been
limited by a lack of deep, high-resolution rest-frame infrared
imaging that accurately traces stellar mass distributions. Here,
we leverage the new capabilities of the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) to measure the 4.4 \ensuremathμm sizes of
åisebox-0.5ex~1000 galaxies with
$\mathrmlogM_* /M_ødot ≥slant 9$ and 1.0
\ensuremathłeq z \ensuremathłeq 2.5 from public CEERS
imaging in the Extended Groth Strip deep field. We compare the
sizes of galaxies measured from NIRCam imaging at 4.4
\ensuremathμm (\ensuremathłambda $_rest$
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 1.6 \ensuremathμm) with
sizes measured at 1.5 \ensuremathμm
(\ensuremathłambda $_rest$
\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~ 5500 \r̊). We find that, on
average, galaxy half-light radii are
\raib̊ox-0.5ex~9% smaller at 4.4
\ensuremathμm than 1.5 \ensuremathμm in this sample.
This size difference is markedly stronger at higher stellar
masses and redder rest-frame V - J colors: galaxies with M
$_*$ \raiso̊x-0.5ex~ 10$^11$ M
$_\ensuremathødot$ have 4.4 \ensuremathμm sizes
that are \raisex̊-0.5ex~30% smaller than their
1.5 \ensuremathμm sizes. Our results indicate that galaxy
mass profiles are significantly more compact than their rest-
frame optical light profiles at cosmic noon, and demonstrate
that spatial variations in age and attenuation are important,
particularly for massive galaxies. The trend we find here
impacts our understanding of the size growth and evolution of
galaxies, and suggests that previous studies based on rest-frame
optical light may not have captured the mass-weighted structural
evolution of galaxies. This paper represents a first step toward
a new understanding of the morphologies of early massive
galaxies enabled by JWST's infrared window into the distant
universe.},
