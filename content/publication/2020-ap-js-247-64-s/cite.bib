 abstract = {The Beyond Ultra-deep Frontier Fields and Legacy Observations (BUFFALO)
is a 101 orbit + 101 parallel Cycle 25 Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) Treasury program taking data from 2018 to 2020. BUFFALO
will expand existing coverage of the Hubble Frontier Fields
(HFF) in Wide Field Camera 3/IR F105W, F125W, and F160W and
Advanced Camera for Surveys/WFC F606W and F814W around each of
the six HFF clusters and flanking fields. This additional area
has not been observed by HST but is already covered by deep
multiwavelength data sets, including Spitzer and Chandra. As
with the original HFF program, BUFFALO is designed to take
advantage of gravitational lensing from massive clusters to
simultaneously find high-redshift galaxies that would otherwise
lie below HST detection limits and model foreground clusters to
study the properties of dark matter and galaxy assembly. The
expanded area will provide the first opportunity to study both
cosmic variance at high redshift and galaxy assembly in the
outskirts of the large HFF clusters. Five additional orbits are
reserved for transient follow-up. BUFFALO data including
mosaics, value-added catalogs, and cluster mass distribution
models will be released via MAST on a regular basis as the
observations and analysis are completed for the six individual
clusters.},
