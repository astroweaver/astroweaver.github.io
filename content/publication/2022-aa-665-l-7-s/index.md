abstract: We report a galaxy group candidate HPC1001 at z ensuremath≈ 3.7 in the COSMOS
  field. This structure was selected as a high galaxy overdensity at z > 3 in the
  COSMOS2020 catalog. It contains ten candidate members, of which eight are assembled
  in a 10″ × 10″ area with the highest sky density among known protoclusters and groups
  at z > 3. Four out of ten sources were also detected at 1.2 mm with Atacama Large
  Millimeter Array continuum observations. Photometric redshifts, measured by four
  independent methods, fall within a narrow range of 3.5 < z < 3.9 and with a weighted
  average of z = 3.65 ensuremath± 0.07. The integrated far-IR-to-radio spectral energy
  distribution yields a total UV and IR star formation rate SFR ensuremath≈ 900 M$_ensuremathødot$
  yr$^ensuremath-1$. We also estimated a halo mass of ensuremath∼10$^13$ M$_ensuremathødot$
  for the structure, which at this redshift is consistent with potential cold gas
  inflow. Remarkably, the most massive member has a specific star formation rate and
  dust to stellar mass ratio of M$_dust$/M$_*$ that are both significantly lower than
  that of star-forming galaxies at this redshift, suggesting that HPC1001 could be
  a z ensuremath≈ 3.7 galaxy group in maturing phase. If confirmed, this would be
  the earliest structure in maturing phase to date, and an ideal laboratory to study
  the formation of the earliest quiescent galaxies as well as cold gas accretion in
  dense environments.
