 abstract = {We report a galaxy group candidate HPC1001 at z \ensuremath≈
3.7 in the COSMOS field. This structure was selected as a high
galaxy overdensity at z > 3 in the COSMOS2020 catalog. It
contains ten candidate members, of which eight are assembled in
a 10″ × 10″ area with the highest sky density among
known protoclusters and groups at z > 3. Four out of ten sources
were also detected at 1.2 mm with Atacama Large Millimeter Array
continuum observations. Photometric redshifts, measured by four
independent methods, fall within a narrow range of 3.5 < z < 3.9
and with a weighted average of z = 3.65 \ensuremath± 0.07.
The integrated far-IR-to-radio spectral energy distribution
yields a total UV and IR star formation rate SFR
\ensuremath≈ 900 M$_\ensuremathødot$
yr$^\ensuremath-1$. We also estimated a halo mass of
\ensuremath∼10$^13$ M$_\ensuremathødot$ for
the structure, which at this redshift is consistent with
potential cold gas inflow. Remarkably, the most massive member
has a specific star formation rate and dust to stellar mass
ratio of M$_dust$/M$_*$ that are both significantly lower
than that of star-forming galaxies at this redshift, suggesting
that HPC1001 could be a z \ensuremath≈ 3.7 galaxy
group in maturing phase. If confirmed, this would be the
earliest structure in maturing phase to date, and an ideal
laboratory to study the formation of the earliest quiescent
galaxies as well as cold gas accretion in dense environments.},
