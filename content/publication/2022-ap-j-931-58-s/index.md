abstract: 'The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is predicted to depend upon the
  temperature of gas in star-forming molecular clouds. The introduction of an additional
  parameter, T $_IMF$, into photometric template fitting, allows galaxies to be fit
  with a range of IMFs. Three surprising new features appear: (1) most star-forming
  galaxies are best fit with a bottom-lighter IMF than the Milky Way; (2) most star-forming
  galaxies at fixed redshift are fit with a very similar IMF; and (3) the most- massive
  star-forming galaxies at fixed redshift instead exhibit a less bottom-light IMF,
  similar to that measured in quiescent galaxies. Additionally, since stellar masses
  and star formation rates both depend on the IMF, these results slightly modify the
  resulting relationship, while yielding similar qualitative characteristics to previous
  studies.'
