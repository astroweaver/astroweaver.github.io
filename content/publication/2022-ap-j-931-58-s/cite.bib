 abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is predicted to depend upon the
temperature of gas in star-forming molecular clouds. The
introduction of an additional parameter, T $_IMF$, into
photometric template fitting, allows galaxies to be fit with a
range of IMFs. Three surprising new features appear: (1) most
star-forming galaxies are best fit with a bottom-lighter IMF
than the Milky Way; (2) most star-forming galaxies at fixed
redshift are fit with a very similar IMF; and (3) the most-
massive star-forming galaxies at fixed redshift instead exhibit
a less bottom-light IMF, similar to that measured in quiescent
galaxies. Additionally, since stellar masses and star formation
rates both depend on the IMF, these results slightly modify the
resulting relationship, while yielding similar qualitative
characteristics to previous studies.},
