abstract: We present a set of multi-wavelength mosaics and photometric catalogs in
  the ALMA lensing cluster survey (ALCS) fields. The catalogs were built by reprocessing
  of archival data from the CHArGE compilation, taken by the $textitHubble Space Telescope$
  ($textitHST$) in the RELICS, CLASH and Hubble Frontier Fields. Additionally we have
  reconstructed the $textitSpitzer$ IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 $μ$m mosaics, by utilising all
  the available archival IRSA/SHA exposures. To alleviate the effect of blending in
  such a crowded region, we have modelled the $textitSpitzer$ photometry by convolving
  the $textitHST$ detection image with the $textitSpitzer$ PSF using the novel $textttgolfir$
  software. The final catalogs contain 218,000 sources, covering a combined area of
  690 arcmin$^2$. These catalogs will serve as an important tool in aiding the search
  of the sub-mm galaxies in future ALMA surveys, as well as follow ups of the $textitHST$
  dark - IRAC sources. Coupled with the available $textitHST$ photometry the addition
  of the 3.6 and 4.5 $μ$m bands will allow us to place a better constraint on photometric
  redshifts and stellar masses of these objects, thus giving us an opportunity to
  identify high-redshift candidates for spectroscopic follow ups and answer the important
  questions regarding the epoch of reionization and formation of first galaxies.
