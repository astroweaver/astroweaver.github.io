 abstract = {We present a set of multi-wavelength mosaics and photometric catalogs in
the ALMA lensing cluster survey (ALCS) fields. The catalogs were
built by reprocessing of archival data from the CHArGE
compilation, taken by the $\textitHubble Space Telescope$
($\textitHST$) in the RELICS, CLASH and Hubble Frontier
Fields. Additionally we have reconstructed the
$\textitSpitzer$ IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 $μ$m mosaics, by utilising
all the available archival IRSA/SHA exposures. To alleviate the
effect of blending in such a crowded region, we have modelled
the $\textitSpitzer$ photometry by convolving the
$\textitHST$ detection image with the $\textitSpitzer$ PSF
using the novel $\textttgolfir$ software. The final catalogs
contain 218,000 sources, covering a combined area of 690
arcmin$^2$. These catalogs will serve as an important tool in
aiding the search of the sub-mm galaxies in future ALMA surveys,
as well as follow ups of the $\textitHST$ dark - IRAC sources.
Coupled with the available $\textitHST$ photometry the
addition of the 3.6 and 4.5 $μ$m bands will allow us to place
a better constraint on photometric redshifts and stellar masses
of these objects, thus giving us an opportunity to identify
high-redshift candidates for spectroscopic follow ups and answer
the important questions regarding the epoch of reionization and
formation of first galaxies.},
