abstract: 'Post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) have recently and rapidly quenched their
  star-formation, thus they are an important way to understand how galaxies transition
  from star-forming late-types to quiescent early-types. The recent discovery of large
  cold gas reservoirs in PSBs calls into question the theory that galaxies must lose
  their gas to become quiescent. Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys
  have revealed two classes of PSBs: central PSBs with central quenching regions and
  ring PSBs with quenching in their outskirts. We analyze a sample of 13 nearby (z
  < 0.1) PSBs with spatially resolved optical IFS data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies
  at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey and matched resolution Atacama Large
  (sub-)Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of $^12$CO(1-0). Disturbed stellar kinematics
  in 7/13 of our PSBs and centrally concentrated molecular gas is consistent with
  a recent merger for most of our sample. In galaxies without merger evidence, alternate
  processes may funnel gas inwards and suppress star-formation, which may include
  outflows, stellar bars, and minor mergers or interactions. The star-formation efficiencies
  of the post- starburst regions in nearly half our galaxies are suppressed while
  the gas fractions are consistent with star-forming galaxies. AGN feedback may drive
  this stabilization, and we observe AGN-consistent emission in the centers of 5/13
  galaxies. Finally, our central and ring PSBs have similar properties except the
  ionized and molecular gas in central PSBs is more disturbed. Overall, the molecular
  gas in our PSBs tends to be compact and highly disturbed, resulting in concentrated
  gas reservoirs unable to form stars efficiently.'
