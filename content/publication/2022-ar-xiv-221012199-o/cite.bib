 abstract = {Post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) have recently and rapidly quenched their
star-formation, thus they are an important way to understand how
galaxies transition from star-forming late-types to quiescent
early-types. The recent discovery of large cold gas reservoirs
in PSBs calls into question the theory that galaxies must lose
their gas to become quiescent. Optical Integral Field
Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys have revealed two classes of PSBs:
central PSBs with central quenching regions and ring PSBs with
quenching in their outskirts. We analyze a sample of 13 nearby
(z < 0.1) PSBs with spatially resolved optical IFS data from the
Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)
survey and matched resolution Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter
Array (ALMA) observations of $^12$CO(1-0). Disturbed stellar
kinematics in 7/13 of our PSBs and centrally concentrated
molecular gas is consistent with a recent merger for most of our
sample. In galaxies without merger evidence, alternate processes
may funnel gas inwards and suppress star-formation, which may
include outflows, stellar bars, and minor mergers or
interactions. The star-formation efficiencies of the post-
starburst regions in nearly half our galaxies are suppressed
while the gas fractions are consistent with star-forming
galaxies. AGN feedback may drive this stabilization, and we
observe AGN-consistent emission in the centers of 5/13 galaxies.
Finally, our central and ring PSBs have similar properties
except the ionized and molecular gas in central PSBs is more
disturbed. Overall, the molecular gas in our PSBs tends to be
compact and highly disturbed, resulting in concentrated gas
reservoirs unable to form stars efficiently.},
