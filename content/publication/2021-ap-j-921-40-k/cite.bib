 abstract = {We analyze the far-infrared (FIR) properties of
åisebox-0.5ex~5000 star-forming galaxies at z
< 4.5, drawn from the deepest, super-deblended catalogs in the
GOODS-N and COSMOS fields. We develop a novel panchromatic
spectral energy distribution fitting algorithm, Stardust, that
models the emission from stars, active galactic nuclei (AGNs),
and infrared dust emission, without relying on energy balance
assumptions. Our code provides robust estimates of the UV-
optical and FIR physical parameters, such as the stellar mass
(M$_*$), dust mass (M$_dust$), infrared luminosities
(L$_IR$) arising from AGN and star formation activity, and the
average intensity of the interstellar radiation field (⟨U⟩).
Through a set of simulations we quantify the completeness of our
data in terms of M$_dust$, L$_IR$, and ⟨U⟩ and subsequently
characterize the distribution and evolution of these parameters
with redshift. We focus on the dust-to-stellar mass ratio
(f$_dust$), which we parameterize as a function of cosmic age,
stellar mass, and specific star formation rate. The f$_dust$
is found to increase by a factor of 10 from z = 0 to z = 2 and
appears to remain flat at higher z, mirroring the evolution of
the gas fraction. We also find a growing fraction of warm to
cold dust with increasing distance from the main sequence,
indicative of more intense interstellar radiation fields, higher
star formation efficiencies, and more compact star-forming
regions for starburst galaxies. Finally, we construct the dust
mass functions (DMFs) of star-forming galaxies up to z = 1 by
transforming the stellar mass function to DMF through the
scaling relations derived here. The evolution of f$_dust$ and
the recovered DMFs are in good agreement with the theoretical
predictions of the Horizon-AGN and IllustrisTNG simulations. *
