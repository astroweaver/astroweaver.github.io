abstract: We analyze the far-infrared (FIR) properties of åisebox-0.5ex~5000 star-forming
  galaxies at z < 4.5, drawn from the deepest, super-deblended catalogs in the GOODS-N
  and COSMOS fields. We develop a novel panchromatic spectral energy distribution
  fitting algorithm, Stardust, that models the emission from stars, active galactic
  nuclei (AGNs), and infrared dust emission, without relying on energy balance assumptions.
  Our code provides robust estimates of the UV- optical and FIR physical parameters,
  such as the stellar mass (M$_*$), dust mass (M$_dust$), infrared luminosities (L$_IR$)
  arising from AGN and star formation activity, and the average intensity of the interstellar
  radiation field (⟨U⟩). Through a set of simulations we quantify the completeness
  of our data in terms of M$_dust$, L$_IR$, and ⟨U⟩ and subsequently characterize
  the distribution and evolution of these parameters with redshift. We focus on the
  dust-to-stellar mass ratio (f$_dust$), which we parameterize as a function of cosmic
  age, stellar mass, and specific star formation rate. The f$_dust$ is found to increase
  by a factor of 10 from z = 0 to z = 2 and appears to remain flat at higher z, mirroring
  the evolution of the gas fraction. We also find a growing fraction of warm to cold
  dust with increasing distance from the main sequence, indicative of more intense
  interstellar radiation fields, higher star formation efficiencies, and more compact
  star-forming regions for starburst galaxies. Finally, we construct the dust mass
  functions (DMFs) of star-forming galaxies up to z = 1 by transforming the stellar
  mass function to DMF through the scaling relations derived here. The evolution of
  f$_dust$ and the recovered DMFs are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions
  of the Horizon-AGN and IllustrisTNG simulations. * https://github.com/VasilyKokorev/stardust/
