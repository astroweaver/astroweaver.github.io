 abstract = {We present a study of 9 242 spectroscopically confirmed quasars with
multiepoch ugriz photometry from the SDSS Southern Survey. By
fitting a separable linear model to each quasar's spectral
variations, we decompose their five-band spectral energy
distributions into variable (disc) and non-variable (host
galaxy) components. In modelling the disc spectra, we include
attenuation by dust on the line of sight through the host galaxy
to its nucleus. We consider five commonly used attenuation laws,
and find that the best description is by dust similar to that of
the Small Magellanic Cloud, inferring a lack of carbonaceous
grains from the relatively weak 2175-̊A absorption feature.
We go on to construct a composite spectrum for the quasar
variations spanning 700-8000 \Å. By varying the assumed
power-law L$_\ensuremathν$ \ensuremath∝
\ensuremathν$^\ensuremathα$ spectral slope, we
find a best-fitting value \ensuremathα = 0.71
\ensuremath± 0.02, excluding at high confidence the
canonical L$_\ensuremathν$ \ensuremath∝
\ensuremathν$^1/3$ prediction for a steady-state
accretion disc with a T \ensuremath∝ r$^-3/4$
temperature profile. The bluer spectral index of the observed
quasar variations instead supports the model of Agol & Krolik,
and Mummery & Balbus, in which a steeper temperature profile, T
\ensuremath∝ r$^-7/8$, develops as a result of
finite magnetically induced stress at the innermost stable
circular orbit extracting energy and angular momentum from the
black hole spin.},
