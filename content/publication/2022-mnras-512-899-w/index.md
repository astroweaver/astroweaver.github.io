abstract: We present a study of 9 242 spectroscopically confirmed quasars with multiepoch
  ugriz photometry from the SDSS Southern Survey. By fitting a separable linear model
  to each quasar's spectral variations, we decompose their five-band spectral energy
  distributions into variable (disc) and non-variable (host galaxy) components. In
  modelling the disc spectra, we include attenuation by dust on the line of sight
  through the host galaxy to its nucleus. We consider five commonly used attenuation
  laws, and find that the best description is by dust similar to that of the Small
  Magellanic Cloud, inferring a lack of carbonaceous grains from the relatively weak
  2175-̊A absorption feature. We go on to construct a composite spectrum for the quasar
  variations spanning 700-8000 Å. By varying the assumed power-law L$_ensuremathν$
  ensuremath∝ ensuremathν$^ensuremathα$ spectral slope, we find a best-fitting value
  ensuremathα = 0.71 ensuremath± 0.02, excluding at high confidence the canonical
  L$_ensuremathν$ ensuremath∝ ensuremathν$^1/3$ prediction for a steady-state accretion
  disc with a T ensuremath∝ r$^-3/4$ temperature profile. The bluer spectral index
  of the observed quasar variations instead supports the model of Agol & Krolik, and
  Mummery & Balbus, in which a steeper temperature profile, T ensuremath∝ r$^-7/8$,
  develops as a result of finite magnetically induced stress at the innermost stable
  circular orbit extracting energy and angular momentum from the black hole spin.
