 abstract = {We report the archival discovery of Ly\ensuremathα emission
from the bright ultraviolet galaxy Y002 at z = 7.677,
spectroscopically confirmed by its ionized carbon [C II] 158
\ensuremathμm emission line. The Ly\ensuremathα
line is spatially associated with the rest-frame UV stellar
emission (M $_UV$ åisebox-0.5ex~ -22,
2× brighter than $M_\mathrmUV^⋆ $ ), and
it appears offset from the peak of the extended [C II] emission
at the current \i̊sebox-0.5ex~1″ spatial
resolution. We derive an estimate of the unobscured SFR$_UV$ =
(22 \ensuremath± 1) M $_\ensuremathødot$ yr$^-1$
and set an upper limit of SFR$_IR$ < 15 M
$_\ensuremathødot$ yr$^-1$ from the far-infrared (FIR)
wavelength range, which globally places Y002 on the SFR(UV+IR)-L
$_[C II]$ correlation observed at lower redshifts. In terms of
velocity, the peak of the Ly\ensuremathα emission is
redshifted by \ensuremathΔv $_Ly\ensuremathα
$ \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~ 500 km s$^-1$ from the
systemic redshift set by [C II] and a high-velocity tail extends
up to \rae̊box-0.5ex~1000 km s$^-1$. The
velocity offset is up to
\raib̊ox-0.5ex~3.5× higher than the
average estimate for similarly UV-bright emitters at z
\raiso̊x-0.5ex~ 6-7, which might suggest that
we are witnessing the merging of two clumps. A combination of
strong outflows and the possible presence of an extended ionized
bubble surrounding Y002 would likely facilitate the escape of
copious Ly\ensuremathα light, as indicated by the large
equivalent width EW$_0$(Ly\ensuremathα)
$\,=\,24_-6^+5$ \rAÅssuming that [C II] traces the
neutral hydrogen, we estimate a H I gas fraction of M $_H I$/M
$_\ensuremath⋆$ \ensuremath\gtrsim 8 for Y002 as a
system and speculate that patches of high H I column densities
could contribute to explaining the observed spatial offsets
between Ly\ensuremathα- and [C II]-emitting regions.
The low dust content, implied by the nondetection of the FIR
continuum emission at rest frame
\raiseb̊-0.5ex~160 \ensuremathμm, would
be sufficient to absorb any potential Ly\ensuremathα
photons produced within the [C II] clump as a result of large H
I column densities.},
