 abstract = {We investigate the strong-lensing cluster Abell 370 (A370) using a wide
Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopic mosaic from the Multi-
Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). IFU spectroscopy provides
significant insight into the structure and mass content of
galaxy clusters, yet IFU-based cluster studies focus almost
exclusively on the central Einstein-radius region. Covering over
14 arcmin$^2$, the new MUSE mosaic extends significantly
beyond the A370 Einstein radius, providing, for the first time,
a detailed look at the cluster outskirts. Combining these data
with wide-field, multi-band Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging
from the BUFFALO project, we analyse the distribution of objects
within the cluster and along the line of sight. Identifying 416
cluster galaxies, we use kinematics to trace the radial mass
profile of the halo, providing a mass estimate independent from
the lens model. We also measure radially averaged properties of
the cluster members, tracking their evolution as a function of
infall. Thanks to the high spatial resolution of our data, we
identify six cluster members acting as galaxy-galaxy lenses,
which constrain localized mass distributions beyond the Einstein
radius. Finally, taking advantage of MUSE's 3D capabilities, we
detect and analyse multiple spatially extended overdensities
outside of the cluster that influence lensing-derived halo mass
estimates. We stress that much of this work is only possible
thanks to the robust, extended IFU coverage, highlighting its
importance even in less optically dense cluster regions.
Overall, this work showcases the power of combining HST + MUSE,
and serves as the initial step towards a larger and wider
program targeting several clusters.},
