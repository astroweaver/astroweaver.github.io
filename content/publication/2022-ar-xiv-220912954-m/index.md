abstract: Recent studies have shown that galaxies at cosmic noon are redder in the
  center and bluer in the outskirts, mirroring results in the local universe. These
  color gradients could be caused by either gradients in the stellar age or dust opacity;
  however, distinguishing between these two causes is impossible with rest- frame
  optical photometry alone. Here we investigate the underlying causes of the gradients
  from spatially-resolved rest- frame $U-V$ vs. $V-J$ color-color diagrams, measured
  from early observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. We use $1, μ m - 4,
  μ m$ NIRCam photometry from the CEERS survey of a sample of 54 galaxies with $M_*
  / M_ødot>10$ at redshifts $1.7<z<2.3$ selected from the 3D-HST catalog. We model
  the light profiles in the F115W, F200W and F356W NIRCam bands using textttimcascade,
  a Bayesian implementation of the Multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) technique which
  flexibly represents galaxy profiles using a series of Gaussians. We construct resolved
  rest-frame $U-V$ and $V-J$ color profiles. The majority of star-forming galaxies
  have negative gradients (i.e. redder in the center, bluer in the outskirts) in both
  $U-V$ and $V-J$ colors consistent with radially decreasing dust attenuation. A smaller
  population (roughly 15%) of star-forming galaxies have positive $U-V$ but negative
  $V-J$ gradients implying centrally concentrated star-formation. For quiescent galaxies
  we find a diversity of UVJ color profiles, with roughly one-third showing star-formation
  in their center. This study showcases the potential of JWST to study the resolved
  stellar populations of galaxies at cosmic noon.
