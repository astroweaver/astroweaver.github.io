 abstract = {We characterize the average X-ray and radio properties of quiescent
galaxies (QGs) with $\mathrmlog(M_⋆ /M_ødot ) 10$
at 0 < z < 5. QGs are photometrically selected from the latest
COSMOS2020 catalog. We conduct the stacking analysis of X-ray
images of the Chandra COSMOS Legacy Survey for individually
undetected QGs. Thanks to the large sample and deep images, the
stacked X-ray signal is significantly detected up to z
åisebox-0.5ex~ 5. The average X-ray luminosity
cannot be explained by the X-ray luminosity of X-ray binaries,
suggesting that the low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
ubiquitously exist in QGs. Moreover, the X-ray AGN luminosity of
QGs at z > 1.5 is higher than that of star-forming galaxies
(SFGs), derived in the same manner as QGs. The stacking analysis
of the VLA-COSMOS images is conducted for the identical sample,
and the radio signal for QGs is also detected up to z
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 5. We find that the radio AGN
luminosity of QGs at z > 1.5 is also higher than SFGs, which is
in good agreement with the X-ray analysis. The enhanced AGN
activity in QGs suggested by the individual analysis in the
X-ray and radio wavelength supports its important role for
quenching at high redshift. Their enhanced AGN activity is less
obvious at z < 1.5, which can be interpreted as an increasing
role of others at lower redshifts, such as environmental
quenching.},
