abstract: "Using NOEMA and ALMA 3mm line scans, we measured spectroscopic redshifts\
  \ of six new dusty galaxies at 3.5 < z < 4.2 by solidly detecting [CI](1-0) and\
  \ CO transitions. The sample was selected from the COSMOS and GOODS-North super-deblended\
  \ catalogs with far- infrared (FIR) photometric redshifts z$_phot$ > 6 based on\
  \ template IR spectral energy distribution (SED) from known submillimeter galaxies\
  \ at z = 4-6. Dust SED analyses explain the z$_phot$ overestimate from seemingly\
  \ cold dust temperatures (T$_d$) and steep Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) slopes, providing\
  \ additional examples of cold dusty galaxies impacted by the cosmic microwave background\
  \ (CMB). We therefore studied the general properties of the enlarged sample of 10\
  \ ``cold'' dusty galaxies over 3.5 < z < 6. We conclude that these galaxies are\
  \ deceivingly cold at the surface but are actually warm in their starbursting cores.\
  \ Several lines of evidence support this scenario: (1) The high infrared surface\
  \ density ensuremathΣ$_IR$ and cold T$_d$ from optically thin models appear to violate\
  \ the Stefan-Boltzmann law; (2) the gas masses derived from optically thin dust\
  \ masses are inconsistent with estimates from dynamics and CI luminosities; (3)\
  \ the implied high star formation efficiencies would conflict with cold T$_d$; and\
  \ (4) high FIR optical depth is implied even using the lower, optically thick dust\
  \ masses. This work confirms the existence of a substantial population of deceivingly\
  \ cold, compact dusty starburst galaxies at z ensuremathgtrsim 4, together with\
  \ the severe impact of the CMB on their RJ observables, paving the way for the diagnostics\
  \ of optically thick dust in the early Universe. Conventional gas mass estimates\
  \ based on RJ dust continuum luminosities implicitly assume an optically thin case,\
  \ which leads to overestimation of gas masses by a factor of 2-3 on average in compact\
  \ dusty star-forming galaxies."
