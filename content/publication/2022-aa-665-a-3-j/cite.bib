 abstract = {Using NOEMA and ALMA 3mm line scans, we measured spectroscopic redshifts
of six new dusty galaxies at 3.5 < z < 4.2 by solidly detecting
[CI](1-0) and CO transitions. The sample was selected from the
COSMOS and GOODS-North super-deblended catalogs with far-
infrared (FIR) photometric redshifts z$_phot$ > 6 based on
template IR spectral energy distribution (SED) from known
submillimeter galaxies at z = 4-6. Dust SED analyses explain the
z$_phot$ overestimate from seemingly cold dust temperatures
(T$_d$) and steep Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) slopes, providing
additional examples of cold dusty galaxies impacted by the
cosmic microwave background (CMB). We therefore studied the
general properties of the enlarged sample of 10 ``cold'' dusty
galaxies over 3.5 < z < 6. We conclude that these galaxies are
deceivingly cold at the surface but are actually warm in their
starbursting cores. Several lines of evidence support this
scenario: (1) The high infrared surface density
\ensuremathΣ$_IR$ and cold T$_d$ from optically
thin models appear to violate the Stefan-Boltzmann law; (2) the
gas masses derived from optically thin dust masses are
inconsistent with estimates from dynamics and CI luminosities;
(3) the implied high star formation efficiencies would conflict
with cold T$_d$; and (4) high FIR optical depth is implied
even using the lower, optically thick dust masses. This work
confirms the existence of a substantial population of
deceivingly cold, compact dusty starburst galaxies at z
\ensuremath\gtrsim 4, together with the severe impact of the
CMB on their RJ observables, paving the way for the diagnostics
of optically thick dust in the early Universe. Conventional gas
mass estimates based on RJ dust continuum luminosities
implicitly assume an optically thin case, which leads to
overestimation of gas masses by a factor of 2-3 on average in
compact dusty star-forming galaxies.},
