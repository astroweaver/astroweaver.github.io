The COSMOS survey is one the longest-running galaxy surveys. Over two decades, we have collected observations of x-ray, optical, infrared, and radio light to obtain galaxy distances and understand their evolution over 13.7 billion years of cosmic history. I lead the 2020 edition of the master galaxy catalog, using bleeding-edge galaxy model-fitting techniques from The Farmer to measure galaxy properties.
