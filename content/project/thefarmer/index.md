>While the increasing depth and area of galaxy surveys promise definitive high-redshift studies, ever more crowded sources challenge current photometric methodology. Recent work by Lang and Hogg (2016) has provided another toolkit: The Tractor. By leveraging our understanding of galaxy morphologies, the Tractor is able to force galaxy models derived from high-resolution images onto less resolved ones, with superior deblending and robust photometric redshifts â”€ advantageous for high-redshift studies. We present the Farmer, a comprehensive software interfacing with The Tractor to detect sources, efficiently determine the best model type for each source, and perform forced photometry in a scalable architecture.
