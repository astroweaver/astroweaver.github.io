In this project a neural network has been designed to classify stars and galaxies, where an optimal use of information and structure of the neural network has been investigated. Thus, the project presents a computationally fast methodology with the freedom to choose between quantity and purity that can accurately predict more than 95 percent of stars and galaxies.
