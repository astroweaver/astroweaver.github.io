The [Cosmic Dawn Survey](https://dawn.ipac.caltech.edu/) is a 50 square degree multi-wavelength survey of the Euclid Deep and Calibration fields. The scientific aim is to understand the co-evolution of galaxies, black holes, and the dark matter haloes that host them from Re-Ionization (z\~12, about 500 million years after the big-bang) to the present (z\~0).  The current dataset comprises ultra-deep griz imaging as part of the [H20 Survey](https://project.ifa.hawaii.edu/h20/) and IRAC infrared imaging from the Spitzer Legacy Survey, and will eventually include near-infrared imaging from the Euclid Space Mission from 2022. I am a co-lead of the photometric extraction, redshift computation, and physical parameters team, using The Farmer to produce bleeding-edge measurements of galaxy properties.
