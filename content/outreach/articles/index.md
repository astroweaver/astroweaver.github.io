## [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/)
Astrobites features daily summaries of academic papers submitted to the ArXiv in the field of astronomy. Most articles are written by graduate students with the aim of a brief but comprehensive coverage of the background, methods, and conclusions. On occasion, we highlight outstanding undergraduate research, and tips for graduate school.

I am a rotation writer for 2019 and 2020, contributing one article per month as well as serving as a peer editor. A listing of my articles can be found [here](https://astrobites.org/author/jweaver/). Here are some recent ones:

> MAY 2020<br>
[The Missing Link: New Insights from Post-starburst Outflows](https://astrobites.org/2020/04/17/the-missing-link-new-insights-from-post-starburst-outflows/)<br>
What can outflowing gas tell us about the connection between rapid galaxy growth and AGN activity?

> APRIL 2020<br>
[The Grand Twirl](https://astrobites.org/2020/03/20/the-grand-twirl/)<br>
How well a galaxy dances may be a matter of life or death.
