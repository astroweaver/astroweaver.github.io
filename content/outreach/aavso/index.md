AVSpec is the first spectral database of the [American Association of Variable Star Observers](www.aavso.org). Accessible to any astronomer with the capability to perform spectroscopy, AVSpec is the world-leading database for amateur spectroscopy of variable stars and novae. 

â€‹I was the Development Director of AVSpec from 2016 - 2018, developing the concept, backend, and frontend of the the database.  I was supported in this role by the 2016 & 2017 Margaret Mayall Fellowships.

The site is now live: [www.aavso.org/apps/specdb](www.aavso.org/apps/specdb)
