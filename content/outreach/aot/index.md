[Astronomy on Tap – Copenhagen](https://www.facebook.com/aotcopenhagen) is a monthly event held at Huset, organised by astronomers in Copenhagen. Each event has a theme and features two astronomy talks as well as a quiz and awesome space music! Talks are in english. 

I helped co-found the Copenhagen chapter in 2019 with a band of other early career (PhD & PostDoc) researchers.
