Beyond their still uncertain role in reionisation, these UV-bright galaxies are ideal laboratories from which to study galaxy formation and constrain the bright-end of the UV luminosity function. Of the 501994 sources detected from a combined YE, JE, and HE NISP detection image, 168 do not have any appreciable VIS/IE flux. These objects span a range in spectral colours, separated into two classes: 139 extremely red sources; and 29 Lyman-break galaxy candidates. Best-fit redshifts and spectral templates suggest the former is composed of both z≳5 dusty star-forming galaxies and z≈1−3 quiescent systems. The latter is composed of more homogeneous Lyman break galaxies at z≈6−8. In both cases, contamination by L- and T-type dwarfs cannot be ruled out with Euclid images alone. Additional contamination from instrumental persistence is investigated using a novel time series analysis. This work lays the foundation for future searches within the Euclid Deep Fields, where thousands more z≳6 Lyman break systems and extremely red sources will be identified.\n","date":1710288e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710288e3,"objectID":"9a401cdf92f6ca5dc9832bd89e69c244","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/post/euclid_lbgs/","publishdate":"2024-03-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/euclid_lbgs/","section":"post","summary":"See Weaver et al. 2024 - [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13505](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13505)","tags":["Academic"],"title":"The First High-z Galaxies from Euclid Have Been Found!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Bingjie Wang","Joel Leja","Hakim Atek","et al."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1709251200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1709251200,"objectID":"cd976881c5ff730cc7e66e3e5d3cbe13","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/publication/wang-2024-a/","publishdate":"2024-10-25T17:56:07.300233Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2024-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Galaxy formation","H II regions","High-redshift galaxies","Initial mass function","Spectral energy distribution","Star formation","Galaxy evolution","595","694","734","796","2129","1569","594","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"title":"Quantifying the Effects of Known Unknowns on Inferred High-redshift Galaxy Properties: Burstiness, IMF, and Nebular Physics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lillian Wright","Katherine E.

The galaxy overdensity may enhance the escape of ionizing photons, making protoclusters crucial in driving the timing and topology of cosmic reionization. We propose to measure the brightest rest-frame-optical emission lines from spectrosopically-confirmed galaxies comprising the largest overdensity yet identified near the midpoint of cosmic reionization, z7OD. Eight protocluster members, identified by their Lyman-alpha emission, are the primary targets for these NIRSpec MOS observations, which will measure rest-frame optical emission lines between the [OII] doublet and hydrogen Balmer alpha lines. We aim to measure the transmission of the IGM in and around an ionized, cosmic bubble, determine the physical properties of the galaxies that ionized the bubble, and compare them to field galaxies at z \u0026gt; 3.37 (observed simultaneously). We will measure the Lyman-alpha escape fraction and the Lyman-alpha velocity offset, information required to map spatial variation in IGM transmission.

Since the last public catalog in 2015, a wealth of new imaging and spectroscopic data has been collected in the COSMOS field. This paper describes the collection, processing, and analysis of this new imaging data to produce a new reference photometric redshift catalog. Source detection and multi-wavelength photometry is performed for 1.7 million sources across the 2deg2 of the COSMOS field, ∼966,000 of which are measured with all available broad-band data using both traditional aperture photometric methods and a new profile-fitting photometric extraction tool, The Farmer, which we have developed. A detailed comparison of the two resulting photometric catalogs is presented. Photometric redshifts are computed for all sources in each catalog utilizing two independent photometric redshift codes. Finally, a comparison is made between the performance of the photometric methodologies and of the redshift codes to demonstrate an exceptional degree of self-consistency in the resulting photometric redshifts. The i\u0026lt;21 sources have sub-percent photometric redshift accuracy and even the faintest sources at 25\u0026lt;i\u0026lt;27 reach a precision of 5%. Finally, these results are discussed in the context of previous, current, and future surveys in the COSMOS field. Compared to COSMOS2015, reaches the same photometric redshift precision at almost one magnitude deeper. Both photometric catalogs and their photometric redshift solutions and physical parameters will be made available through the usual astronomical archive systems (ESO Phase 3, IPAC IRSA, and CDS).\n","date":1642032e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642032e3,"objectID":"f1c5b34113972ec7b8d2d40c5fc2cf9a","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/post/c2020_accepted/","publishdate":"2022-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/c2020_accepted/","section":"post","summary":"Catalogs and data products are now available - [https://cosmos2020.calet.org/](https://cosmos2020.calet.org/)","tags":["Academic"],"title":"The COSMOS2020 Catalog has been published in ApJS!","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Keck/MOSFIRE | 2N | PI - C.

They are interpreted as a population of galaxies which have recently undergone a major episode of star formation, and their study may elucidate the nature of galaxy bimodality. We employ a principal component analysis to study a sample of 32 low redshift (0.01 \u0026lt; z \u0026lt; 0.11) PSBs selected with SDSS DR 7 single-fibre spectroscopy and observed with MaNGA integral field spectroscopy. Morphologies are examined to characterise the sample, finding a mixture of starforming and quiescent parameters, indicative of tran- sition. We find that this rich sample exhibits strong radial gradients in stellar age, as measured by the principal components (PC) corresponding to the 4000-Å break strength and excess Hδ absorption. To examine the extent of aperture bias, we com- pare these two properties between the DR 7 and MaNGA spectra, integrated over 3\u0026#34; and the full aperture, finding evidence for systematics and radial gradients. We em- ploy two stellar population synthesis codes (BC03, FSPS) to test the manner in which star-formation proceeded, either as a single radially evolving burst, or coeval with varying burst strengths. Achieved here for the first time, we find a remarkable consistency between the models and gradients, suggesting complex and diverse star-formation histories. We show that this method, coupled with an increased sample size, is well-suited to elucidate the real nature of these strange and peculiar objects.\n","date":1625826888,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625826888,"objectID":"ead7406a6277bf3c2a7f8e3a136bb7c8","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/project/psb_manga/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T10:34:48.352Z","relpermalink":"/project/psb_manga/","section":"project","summary":"MPhys Thesis | We use SDSS-MaNGA integral field spectroscopy to investigate a sample of rare post-starbust galaxies","tags":["Galaxy Evolution"],"title":"Exploring the Origins of Galaxy Bimodality at z\u003c0.1","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625826888,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625826888,"objectID":"b16292266ed0b4c3bc0ffbc540a1f3bf","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/project/cosmos2020-smf/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T10:34:48.352Z","relpermalink":"/project/cosmos2020-smf/","section":"project","summary":"We construct and model the Stellar Mass and Mass Density Functions from the COSMOS2020 catalog","tags":["Galaxy Evolution","Featured"],"title":"Galaxy Stellar Mass Assembly History Over 13 Billion Years","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"PAPER: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09691 NGC7252, which is one of the nearest major-merger galaxy remnants, is an ideal laboratory to study the processes inherent to the transformation of disc galaxies to ellipticals as observed about ~1Gyr after the collision. We obtained wide-field IFU spectroscopy with the VLT-VIMOS integral-field spectrograph covering the central 50\u0026#34;x50\u0026#34; of NGC7252 to map the stellar and ionised gas kinematics, and the distribution and conditions of the ionised gas, revealing the extent of ongoing star formation and recent star formation history. We find that the inner gas disc is not counter-rotating with respect to the stars and that the stellar kinematics appear complex with a clear indication of a prolate-like rotation component suggesting a polar merger configuration. The ongoing star formation rate is 2.2+-0.6 M_sun/yr and implies a typical depletion time of 2Gyr given the molecular gas content. Furthermore, the spatially-resolved star formation history suggests a slight radial dependence, moving outwards at later times. We confirm a large AGN-ionised gas cloud previously discovered 5kpc south of the nucleus, and find higher ionisation also at the galaxy centre relative to the surrounding gas disc. Although the higher ionisation towards the centre is potentially degenerate within the central star forming ring, it may be associated with a low-luminosity AGN. Although NGC7252 has been classified as post-starburst galaxy at the centre, the elliptical-like major-merger remnant still appears very active. A central kpc-scale gas disc has presumably re-formed quickly within the last 100Myr after final coalescence. The disc features ongoing star formation, implying Gyr long timescale to reach the red sequence through gas consumption alone. While NGC7252 is useful to probe the transformation from discs to ellipticals, it is not well-suited to study the transformation from blue to red at this point.\n","date":1625826888,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625826888,"objectID":"22544358b18324cd725f272769fe9a6b","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/project/ngc7252/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T10:34:48.352Z","relpermalink":"/project/ngc7252/","section":"project","summary":"We use ESO's VLT telescope to disect NGC 7252 with spatially resolved spectroscopy","tags":["Galaxy Evolution"],"title":"History and Destiny of a Major Merger Remnant","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Co-supervised Albert Sneppen, DAWN Summer Student (2015) In this project a neural network has been designed to classify stars and galaxies, where an optimal use of information and structure of the neural network has been investigated.

The starbursting dwarf irregular NGC 1427A presents an interesting case as it is being pulled into the nearby Fornax cluster at supersonic speeds, producing a visibly exceptional star formation rate and notably blue colors. It has been suggested that the highly deformed structure of NGC 1427A is due to ram pressure stripping as a result of interacting with a super-heated ICM provided by several nearby elliptical galaxies. The gas density profile of its leading edge is similar to a “bow-shock”, containing several dozen super-star clusters (SSCs) and thousands of smaller star forming clusters. It is clearly evident that the properties of NGC 1427A change rapidly over relatively short distances. Using dithered HST/ACS images in Sloan equivalent g’ r’ i’ z’ and Hα filters, we present a morphological and photometric study of NGC 1427A using a novel approach in which stellar properties are measured from sources grouped within localized regions. Apertures are fitted for ~5000 sources at 4σ using a filter-combined master image. Four characteristic regions are chosen to study stellar properties, selected interactively through DS9. We then introduce COMET, a specially-designed source catalog handler for producing graphical figures of each region, cropping both spatially and photometrically. These are then batch-reviewed and analyzed using synthetic isochrones corresponding of each region. Hα bright sources are indicated to illustrate the significance of SSCs. Secondary analysis is carried out using smoothed color maps of source-subtracted diffuse light, yielding penetrative mapping of underlying stellar populations. We show for the first time how the dynamical stellar populations of NGC 1427A differ as a function of position across the surface of the galaxy, ultimately furthering our understanding of cluster interactions and the evolution of irregular galaxies.

Now in the decade of groundbreaking optical-NIR facilities such as the Nancy Roman Space Telescope, alongside JWST, LSST, and Euclid, the stage is set to probe deeper into the Universe than ever before. COSMOS is the natural stepping stone in this progressively deeper investigation and has been selected as one of the primary calibration fields for forthcoming surveys.

Post-starburst galaxies are an ideal laboratory to study the galaxy transition process as they have undergone a recent, rapid shutdown in star formation, and are expected to be devoid of cold gas. Surprisingly, many of these galaxies still host large reservoirs of molecular gas, which challenges our current picture of quenching. Recent studies of these galaxies suffered from an aperture bias - we know rapid quenching of star formation occured in some regions but we only have unresolved measurements of the molecular gas. We propose to map CO(1-0) emission at 2.5\u0026#34; resolution matched to optical integral field spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey in 13 post-starburst galaxies.
