Since the last public catalog in 2015, a wealth of new imaging and spectroscopic data has been collected in the COSMOS field. This paper describes the collection, processing, and analysis of this new imaging data to produce a new reference photometric redshift catalog. Source detection and multi-wavelength photometry is performed for 1.7 million sources across the 2deg2 of the COSMOS field, ∼966,000 of which are measured with all available broad-band data using both traditional aperture photometric methods and a new profile-fitting photometric extraction tool, The Farmer, which we have developed. A detailed comparison of the two resulting photometric catalogs is presented. Photometric redshifts are computed for all sources in each catalog utilizing two independent photometric redshift codes. Finally, a comparison is made between the performance of the photometric methodologies and of the redshift codes to demonstrate an exceptional degree of self-consistency in the resulting photometric redshifts. The i\u0026lt;21 sources have sub-percent photometric redshift accuracy and even the faintest sources at 25\u0026lt;i\u0026lt;27 reach a precision of 5%. Finally, these results are discussed in the context of previous, current, and future surveys in the COSMOS field. Compared to COSMOS2015, reaches the same photometric redshift precision at almost one magnitude deeper. Both photometric catalogs and their photometric redshift solutions and physical parameters will be made available through the usual astronomical archive systems (ESO Phase 3, IPAC IRSA, and CDS).\n","date":1642032e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642032e3,"objectID":"f1c5b34113972ec7b8d2d40c5fc2cf9a","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/post/c2020_accepted/","publishdate":"2022-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/c2020_accepted/","section":"post","summary":"Catalogs and data products are now available - [https://cosmos2020.calet.org/](https://cosmos2020.calet.org/)","tags":["Academic"],"title":"The COSMOS2020 Catalog has been published in ApJS!","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Keck/MOSFIRE | 2N | PI - C.

From our previous runs (S17B- 106, S18B-040, S20B-031),(1) we have confirmed three z = 4.010, 3.99 and 3.775 galaxies, all of which are the highest redshift quiescent galaxies known to date, and (2) we have measured stellar velocity dispersions of the z = 4.010 and 3.99 galaxies, revealing that the mass in the core of these galaxies does not significantly evolve over the last 12 Gyr, which is consistent with the 2-phase formation scenario. Building upon three papers from our previous runs (Tanaka+ 2019, Valentino+ 2020, Tanaka+ in prep), we now propose to observe the most distant quenching galaxy candidate from our sample in COSMOS at z ∼ 4.7 based on the latest COSMOS2020 catalog with superb photometric quality. We aim (1) to spectroscopically confirm the emergence of the first quiescent galaxies when the Universe was only 1.2 Gyr old, and (2) to fully capture the Balmer break in the K-band to measure their star formation epoch and timescale, which will, combined with state-of-the-art simulations, give us new insights into key physics of very early quenching.\n","date":1641986112,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641986112,"objectID":"55a2dfacc5a22fd4a880674596bd87b9","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_subaru_tanaka/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/observation/2022_subaru_tanaka/","section":"observation","summary":"Keck/MOSFIRE | 2N | PI - M.

Here we present powerful new constraints on UV emission from sources contributing to the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) at its very onset, at only 500 Myr after the Big Bang. We identify these sources with the new COSMOS2020 galaxy catalog, which utilizes new ultra-deep optical and near-infrared imaging necessary to securely identify candidate galaxies from the EoR, each with four consistent measurements of photometric redshift and UV luminosity. Encouraged by this unprecedented agreement, we confirm a highly significant departure from the expected Schechter Function form of the UV LF seen in the local universe, suggesting that galaxy evolution has yet to set in at these early times. An already approved JWST Cycle 1 program (PI: Weaver) will target five of the most robust and most UV-luminous (MUV ~ -22.5) z~9 galaxies in COSMOS with detailed spatially resolved spectroscopy.

They are interpreted as a population of galaxies which have recently undergone a major episode of star formation, and their study may elucidate the nature of galaxy bimodality. We employ a principal component analysis to study a sample of 32 low redshift (0.01 \u0026lt; z \u0026lt; 0.11) PSBs selected with SDSS DR 7 single-fibre spectroscopy and observed with MaNGA integral field spectroscopy. Morphologies are examined to characterise the sample, finding a mixture of starforming and quiescent parameters, indicative of tran- sition. We find that this rich sample exhibits strong radial gradients in stellar age, as measured by the principal components (PC) corresponding to the 4000-Å break strength and excess Hδ absorption. To examine the extent of aperture bias, we com- pare these two properties between the DR 7 and MaNGA spectra, integrated over 3\u0026quot; and the full aperture, finding evidence for systematics and radial gradients. We em- ploy two stellar population synthesis codes (BC03, FSPS) to test the manner in which star-formation proceeded, either as a single radially evolving burst, or coeval with varying burst strengths. Achieved here for the first time, we find a remarkable consistency between the models and gradients, suggesting complex and diverse star-formation histories. We show that this method, coupled with an increased sample size, is well-suited to elucidate the real nature of these strange and peculiar objects.\n","date":1625826888,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625826888,"objectID":"ead7406a6277bf3c2a7f8e3a136bb7c8","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/project/psb_manga/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T10:34:48.352Z","relpermalink":"/project/psb_manga/","section":"project","summary":"MPhys Thesis | We use SDSS-MaNGA integral field spectroscopy to investigate a sample of rare post-starbust galaxies","tags":["Galaxy Evolution"],"title":"Exploring the Origins of Galaxy Bimodality at z\u003c0.1","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625826888,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625826888,"objectID":"b16292266ed0b4c3bc0ffbc540a1f3bf","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/project/cosmos2020-smf/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T10:34:48.352Z","relpermalink":"/project/cosmos2020-smf/","section":"project","summary":"We construct and model the Stellar Mass and Mass Density Functions from the COSMOS2020 catalog","tags":["Galaxy Evolution","Featured"],"title":"Galaxy Stellar Mass Assembly History Over 13 Billion Years","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"PAPER: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09691 NGC7252, which is one of the nearest major-merger galaxy remnants, is an ideal laboratory to study the processes inherent to the transformation of disc galaxies to ellipticals as observed about ~1Gyr after the collision. We obtained wide-field IFU spectroscopy with the VLT-VIMOS integral-field spectrograph covering the central 50\u0026quot;x50\u0026quot; of NGC7252 to map the stellar and ionised gas kinematics, and the distribution and conditions of the ionised gas, revealing the extent of ongoing star formation and recent star formation history. We find that the inner gas disc is not counter-rotating with respect to the stars and that the stellar kinematics appear complex with a clear indication of a prolate-like rotation component suggesting a polar merger configuration. The ongoing star formation rate is 2.2+-0.6 M_sun/yr and implies a typical depletion time of 2Gyr given the molecular gas content. Furthermore, the spatially-resolved star formation history suggests a slight radial dependence, moving outwards at later times. We confirm a large AGN-ionised gas cloud previously discovered 5kpc south of the nucleus, and find higher ionisation also at the galaxy centre relative to the surrounding gas disc. Although the higher ionisation towards the centre is potentially degenerate within the central star forming ring, it may be associated with a low-luminosity AGN. Although NGC7252 has been classified as post-starburst galaxy at the centre, the elliptical-like major-merger remnant still appears very active. A central kpc-scale gas disc has presumably re-formed quickly within the last 100Myr after final coalescence. The disc features ongoing star formation, implying Gyr long timescale to reach the red sequence through gas consumption alone.

The starbursting dwarf irregular NGC 1427A presents an interesting case as it is being pulled into the nearby Fornax cluster at supersonic speeds, producing a visibly exceptional star formation rate and notably blue colors. It has been suggested that the highly deformed structure of NGC 1427A is due to ram pressure stripping as a result of interacting with a super-heated ICM provided by several nearby elliptical galaxies. The gas density profile of its leading edge is similar to a \u0026ldquo;bow-shock\u0026rdquo;, containing several dozen super-star clusters (SSCs) and thousands of smaller star forming clusters. It is clearly evident that the properties of NGC 1427A change rapidly over relatively short distances. Using dithered HST/ACS images in Sloan equivalent g\u0026rsquo; r\u0026rsquo; i\u0026rsquo; z\u0026rsquo; and Hα filters, we present a morphological and photometric study of NGC 1427A using a novel approach in which stellar properties are measured from sources grouped within localized regions. Apertures are fitted for ~5000 sources at 4σ using a filter-combined master image. Four characteristic regions are chosen to study stellar properties, selected interactively through DS9. We then introduce COMET, a specially-designed source catalog handler for producing graphical figures of each region, cropping both spatially and photometrically. These are then batch-reviewed and analyzed using synthetic isochrones corresponding of each region. Hα bright sources are indicated to illustrate the significance of SSCs. Secondary analysis is carried out using smoothed color maps of source-subtracted diffuse light, yielding penetrative mapping of underlying stellar populations. We show for the first time how the dynamical stellar populations of NGC 1427A differ as a function of position across the surface of the galaxy, ultimately furthering our understanding of cluster interactions and the evolution of irregular galaxies.

Valentino\nWe request 30h of NOEMA/2mm time to spectroscopically confirm the redshift of a novel and robust UV- bright (MUV=-22.9 mag) galaxy candidate at z=9.82 from the new COSMOS2020 catalog. The candidate is massive (log(M/Msun)=10.5), highly star-forming (log(SFR/Msun/yr)=2.2), and shows a tight redshift PDF, which can be covered at 90% with a single NOEMA frequency setting targeting [CII]. These properties suggest a sufficient metal enrichment and encourage the search for this line and its underlying dust continuum emission. If confirmed, this will be a redshift record-breaking discovery, while the [CII] and dust IR luminosity will give us insight into the gas and obscured SFR. This will allow us to explore the SFR or MUV-L[CII] and IRX-beta relations at the unprecedented z~10 regime.

Since our last public catalog in 2015, a wealth of new imaging and spectroscopic data has been collected in COSMOS. We describe the collection, processing, and analysis of the best available imaging data in COSMOS over 39 bands and produce a new reference photometric redshift catalog. Powerful new constraints are made possible from the ultra-deep optical imaging with Hyper Suprime-Cam, UltraVISTA near-infrared Ks imaging at least 1 magnitude deeper than in 2015, and the inclusion of all Spitzer IRAC infrared imaging ever taken on COSMOS. We find significant improvement in our astrometric reference from 2015 by utilizing Gaia DR1. From this reprocessed data, we perform source detection and photometry for 1 million sources across 2 deg2 of the COSMOS field, using both traditional aperture photometric methods and a new profile-fitting photometric measurement tool we have developed. In addition to a detailed comparison of both methods, we report the achievement of sub-percent accuracy in our derived photometric redshifts at i \u0026lt; 22.5 AB and at 25 \u0026lt; i \u0026lt; 27 of less than 5 per-cent. Encouraged by this result, we present measurements of the deepest wide-field NIR-selected galaxy number counts and discuss several immediate science projects enabled by this work including the galaxy stellar mass and UV luminosity functions as well as constraints on the halo occupation distribution.\n","date":1610450112,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610450112,"objectID":"b3dc594ecca8d8bcacf40406c59b836b","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/talk/aas2021/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/aas2021/","section":"talk","summary":"237th Meeting of the American Astromical Society","tags":["contributed"],"title":"COSMOS2020: A panchromatic view of the Universe to z~10","type":"talk"},{"authors":["J.~R.

The unique combination of a wide-field near-infrared imaging coupled with new ultra-deep optical and infrared data makes this the most secure sample of 9\u0026lt;z\u0026lt;10 galaxy candidates currently available. However, these objects are too rare to be found by very deep, but smaller surveys with JWST, and the serendipitous discovery of even one such galaxy outside of COSMOS is unlikely from the entirety of planned GTO and ERS programs. These massive, luminous galaxies, seen only 500 million years after the Big Bang, are ideal tracers of the primordial dark matter structures from which they formed and grew. However, their mere existence at these early times challenges the current paradigm of early galaxy formation and evolution.

It is then no surprise that it has played a pivotal role in our understanding of galaxy evolution, especially at early times where sources are too faint to be studied en masse by comparably shallow, wide-field surveys. Now in the decade of groundbreaking optical-NIR facilities such as the Nancy Roman Space Telescope, alongside JWST, LSST, and Euclid, the stage is set to probe deeper into the Universe than ever before. COSMOS is the natural stepping stone in this progressively deeper investigation and has been selected as one of the primary calibration fields for forthcoming surveys. It is for these reasons why we must continue to innovate. We present COSMOS2020, the latest installment of catalogs to map COSMOS, now at unprecedented optical-NIR depths in excess of 28 mags over 2 deg2. A total of 37 bands of photometry are newly extracted for 1M sources using bleeding-edge profile-fitting photometry provided by The Tractor. We find intensely competitive measurements compared to an identical extraction with SExtractor, benchmarked by photometric redshift accuracy below 2% at i \u0026lt; 24.

However, the exact mechanisms that lead to the disruption of the gas supply, the relative importance of different quenching mechanisms, and the timescales involved are still poorly understood. Post-starburst galaxies are an ideal laboratory to study the galaxy transition process as they have undergone a recent, rapid shutdown in star formation, and are expected to be devoid of cold gas. Surprisingly, many of these galaxies still host large reservoirs of molecular gas, which challenges our current picture of quenching. Recent studies of these galaxies suffered from an aperture bias - we know rapid quenching of star formation occured in some regions but we only have unresolved measurements of the molecular gas. We propose to map CO(1-0) emission at 2.5\u0026quot; resolution matched to optical integral field spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey in 13 post-starburst galaxies. We will determine whether a low gas fraction in post-starburst regions is the cause of quenching, or if gas is forming stars inefficiently.
