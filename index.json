The recent discovery of large cold gas reservoirs in PSBs calls into question the theory that galaxies must lose their gas to become quiescent. Optical Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) surveys have revealed two classes of PSBs: central PSBs with central quenching regions and ring PSBs with quenching in their outskirts. We analyze a sample of 13 nearby (z \u003c 0.1) PSBs with spatially resolved optical IFS data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey and matched resolution Atacama Large (sub-)Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of $^12$CO(1-0). Disturbed stellar kinematics in 7/13 of our PSBs and centrally concentrated molecular gas is consistent with a recent merger for most of our sample. In galaxies without merger evidence, alternate processes may funnel gas inwards and suppress star-formation, which may include outflows, stellar bars, and minor mergers or interactions. The star-formation efficiencies of the post- starburst regions in nearly half our galaxies are suppressed while the gas fractions are consistent with star-forming galaxies. AGN feedback may drive this stabilization, and we observe AGN-consistent emission in the centers of 5/13 galaxies. Finally, our central and ring PSBs have similar properties except the ionized and molecular gas in central PSBs is more disturbed. Overall, the molecular gas in our PSBs tends to be compact and highly disturbed, resulting in concentrated gas reservoirs unable to form stars efficiently.","tags":["\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\""],"title":"Resolved Molecular Gas Observations of MaNGA Post-starbursts Reveal a Tumultuous Past","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katherine A.

However, at z ensuremathgtrsim 1 these studies have been limited by a lack of deep, high-resolution rest-frame infrared imaging that accurately traces stellar mass distributions. Here, we leverage the new capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the 4.4 ensuremathμm sizes of åisebox-0.5ex~1000 galaxies with $mathrmlogM_* /M_ødot ≥slant 9$ and 1.0 ensuremathłeq z ensuremathłeq 2.5 from public CEERS imaging in the Extended Groth Strip deep field. We compare the sizes of galaxies measured from NIRCam imaging at 4.4 ensuremathμm (ensuremathłambda $_rest$ i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 1.6 ensuremathμm) with sizes measured at 1.5 ensuremathμm (ensuremathłambda $_rest$ rs̊ebox-0.5ex~ 5500 r̊). We find that, on average, galaxy half-light radii are raib̊ox-0.5ex~9% smaller at 4.4 ensuremathμm than 1.5 ensuremathμm in this sample. This size difference is markedly stronger at higher stellar masses and redder rest-frame V - J colors: galaxies with M $_*$ raiso̊x-0.5ex~ 10$^11$ M $_ensuremathødot$ have 4.4 ensuremathμm sizes that are raisex̊-0.5ex~30% smaller than their 1.5 ensuremathμm sizes. Our results indicate that galaxy mass profiles are significantly more compact than their rest- frame optical light profiles at cosmic noon, and demonstrate that spatial variations in age and attenuation are important, particularly for massive galaxies. The trend we find here impacts our understanding of the size growth and evolution of galaxies, and suggests that previous studies based on rest-frame optical light may not have captured the mass-weighted structural evolution of galaxies. This paper represents a first step toward a new understanding of the morphologies of early massive galaxies enabled by JWST's infrared window into the distant universe.","tags":["\"Galaxy evolution\"","\"Galaxy formation\"","\"Galaxy radii\"","\"594\"","\"595\"","\"617\"","\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\""],"title":"Rest-frame Near-infrared Sizes of Galaxies at Cosmic Noon: Objects in JWST's Mirror Are Smaller than They Appeared","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nikolaj B.

The method has previously been tested with hydrodynamical simulations in Davidzon et al. (2019, MNRAS, 489, 4817), however, here it is applied to real data for the first time. It is crucial for its implementation to build the SOM with a high-quality panchromatic data set, thus we selected ``COSMOS2020'' galaxy catalog for this purpose. After the training and calibration steps with COSMOS2020, other galaxies can be processed through SOMs to obtain an estimate of their stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). Both quantities resulted in a good agreement with independent measurements derived from more extended photometric baseline and, in addition, their combination (i.e., the SFR vs. stellar mass diagram) shows a main sequence of star-forming galaxies that is consistent with the findings of previous studies. We discuss the advantages of this method compared to traditional SED fitting, highlighting the impact of replacing the usual synthetic templates with a collection of empirical SEDs built by the SOM in a ``data-driven'' way. Such an approach also allows, even for extremely large data sets, for an efficient visual inspection to identify photometric errors or peculiar galaxy types. While also considering the computational speed of this new estimator, we argue that it will play a valuable role in the analysis of oncoming large-area surveys such as Euclid of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Telescope.","tags":["\"galaxies: fundamental parameters\"","\"galaxies: star formation\"","\"galaxies: stellar content\"","\"methods: observational\"","\"astronomical databases: miscellaneous\"","\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\"","\"Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics\""],"title":"COSMOS2020: Manifold learning to estimate physical parameters in large galaxy surveys","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuowen Jin","Emanuele Daddi","Georgios E.

The sample was selected from the COSMOS and GOODS-North super-deblended catalogs with far- infrared (FIR) photometric redshifts z$_phot$ \u003e 6 based on template IR spectral energy distribution (SED) from known submillimeter galaxies at z = 4-6. Dust SED analyses explain the z$_phot$ overestimate from seemingly cold dust temperatures (T$_d$) and steep Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) slopes, providing additional examples of cold dusty galaxies impacted by the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We therefore studied the general properties of the enlarged sample of 10 ``cold'' dusty galaxies over 3.5 \u003c z \u003c 6. We conclude that these galaxies are deceivingly cold at the surface but are actually warm in their starbursting cores. Several lines of evidence support this scenario: (1) The high infrared surface density ensuremathΣ$_IR$ and cold T$_d$ from optically thin models appear to violate the Stefan-Boltzmann law; (2) the gas masses derived from optically thin dust masses are inconsistent with estimates from dynamics and CI luminosities; (3) the implied high star formation efficiencies would conflict with cold T$_d$; and (4) high FIR optical depth is implied even using the lower, optically thick dust masses. This work confirms the existence of a substantial population of deceivingly cold, compact dusty starburst galaxies at z ensuremathgtrsim 4, together with the severe impact of the CMB on their RJ observables, paving the way for the diagnostics of optically thick dust in the early Universe. Conventional gas mass estimates based on RJ dust continuum luminosities implicitly assume an optically thin case, which leads to overestimation of gas masses by a factor of 2-3 on average in compact dusty star-forming galaxies.","tags":["\"Galaxy: evolution\"","\"galaxies: high-redshift\"","\"submillimeter: galaxies\"","\"galaxies: ISM\"","\"galaxies: star formation\"","\"cosmic background radiation\"","\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\"","\"Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics\""],"title":"Diagnosing deceivingly cold dusty galaxies at 3.5 \u003c z \u003c 6: A substantial population of compact starbursts with high infrared optical depths","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tim B.

In order to understand the capabilities of measuring morphologies from Euclid-detected galaxies and to help implement measurements in the pipeline, we have conducted the Euclid Morphology Challenge, which we present in two papers. While the companion paper by Merlin et al. focuses on the analysis of photometry, this paper assesses the accuracy of the parametric galaxy morphology measurements in imaging predicted from within the Euclid Wide Survey. We evaluate the performance of five state- of-the-art surface-brightness-fitting codes DeepLeGATo, Galapagos-2, Morfometryka, Profit and SourceXtractor++ on a sample of about 1.5 million simulated galaxies resembling reduced observations with the Euclid VIS and NIR instruments. The simulations include analytic Sérsic profiles with one and two components, as well as more realistic galaxies generated with neural networks. We find that, despite some code-specific differences, all methods tend to achieve reliable structural measurements (10% scatter on ideal Sérsic simulations) down to an apparent magnitude of about 23 in one component and 21 in two components, which correspond to a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 1 and 5 respectively. We also show that when tested on non-analytic profiles, the results are typically degraded by a factor of 3, driven by systematics. We conclude that the Euclid official Data Releases will deliver robust structural parameters for at least 400 million galaxies in the Euclid Wide Survey by the end of the mission. We find that a key factor for explaining the different behaviour of the codes at the faint end is the set of adopted priors for the various structural parameters.","tags":["\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\"","\"Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics\""],"title":"Euclid preparation XXVI: The Euclid Morphology Challenge.

A software pipeline to automatically process and analyse such a huge amount of data in real time is being developed by the Science Ground Segment of the Euclid Consortium; this pipeline will include a model-fitting algorithm, which will provide photometric and morphological estimates of paramount importance for the core science goals of the mission and for legacy science. The Euclid Morphology Challenge is a comparative investigation of the performance of five model-fitting software packages on simulated Euclid data, aimed at providing the baseline to identify the best suited algorithm to be implemented in the pipeline. In this paper we describe the simulated data set, and we discuss the photometry results. A companion paper (Euclid Collaboration: Bretonnière et al. 2022) is focused on the structural and morphological estimates. We created mock Euclid images simulating five fields of view of 0.48 deg2 each in the $I_E$ band of the VIS instrument, each with three realisations of galaxy profiles (single and double Sérsic, and 'realistic' profiles obtained with a neural network); for one of the fields in the double Sérsic realisation, we also simulated images for the three near-infrared $Y_E$, $J_E$ and $H_E$ bands of the NISP-P instrument, and five Rubin/LSST optical complementary bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$). To analyse the results we created diagnostic plots and defined ad-hoc metrics. Five model- fitting software packages (DeepLeGATo, Galapagos-2, Morfometryka, ProFit, and SourceXtractor++) were compared, all typically providing good results.

As a proof of concept, using the recently updated COSMOS catalog (COSMOS2020), we identify the most relevant wavebands for measuring the physical properties of galaxies in a Hawaii Two-0 (H20)- and UVISTA-like survey for a sample of $i\u003c25$ AB mag galaxies. We find that with available $i$-band fluxes, $r$, $u$, IRAC/$ch2$ and $z$ bands provide most of the information regarding the redshift with importance decreasing from $r$-band to $z$-band. We also find that for the same sample, IRAC/$ch2$, $Y$, $r$ and $u$ bands are the most relevant bands in stellar mass measurements with decreasing order of importance. Investigating the inter- correlation between the bands, we train a model to predict UVISTA observations in near-IR from H20-like observations. We find that magnitudes in $YJH$ bands can be simulated/predicted with an accuracy of $1σ$ mag scatter $łesssim 0.2$ for galaxies brighter than 24 AB mag in near-IR bands. One should note that these conclusions depend on the selection criteria of the sample. For any new sample of galaxies with a different selection, these results should be remeasured. Our results suggest that in the presence of a limited number of bands, a machine learning model trained over the population of observed galaxies with extensive spectral coverage outperforms template- fitting. Such a machine learning model maximally comprises the information acquired over available extensive surveys and breaks degeneracies in the parameter space of template-fitting inevitable in the presence of a few bands.","tags":["\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\""],"title":"A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Missing Flux Densities in Multi-band Galaxy Surveys","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Starting from accurate photometric redshifts, we measured the near-infrared selected two-point angular correlation and stellar mass functions in ten redshift bins. We used a phenomenological model that parametrizes the stellar-to- halo mass relation for central galaxies and the number of galaxies inside each halo to describe our observations. This model qualitatively reproduces our measurements and their dependence on the stellar mass threshold. Surprisingly, the mean halo occupation distribution only shows a mild evolution with redshift suggesting that galaxies occupy halos similarly throughout cosmic time. At each redshift, we measured the ratio of stellar mass to halo mass, M$_*$/M$_h$, which shows the characteristic strong dependence of halo mass with a peak at M$_h$$^peak$ ensuremath∼ 2 × 10$^12$ M$_ensuremathødot$. For the first time, using a joint modeling of clustering and abundances, we measured the evolution of M$_h$$^peak$ from z = 0.2 to z = 5.5. M$_h$$^peak$ increases gradually with redshift from log M$_h$$^peak$/M$_ensuremathødot$ ensuremath∼ 12.1 at z ensuremath∼ 0.3 to log M$_h$$^peak$/M$_ensuremathødot$ ensuremath∼ 12.3 at z ensuremath∼ 2, and up to log M$_h$$^peak$/M$_ensuremathødot$ ensuremath∼ 12.9 at z ensuremath∼ 5. Similarly, the stellar mass peak M$_ensuremath*$$^peak$ increases with redshift from log M$_ensuremath*$$^peak$/M$_ensuremathødot$ ensuremath∼ 10.5 at z ensuremath∼ 0.3 to log M$_ensuremath*$$^peak$/M$_ensuremathødot$ ensuremath∼ 10.9 at z ensuremath∼ 3. The SHMR ratio at the peak halo mass remains almost constant with redshift. These results are in accordance with the scenario in which the peak of star-formation efficiency moves toward more massive halos at higher redshifts. We also measured the fraction of satellites as a function of stellar mass and redshift. For all stellar mass thresholds, the satellite fraction decreases at higher redshifts. At a given redshift, there is a higher fraction of low-mass satellites and this fraction reaches a plateau at ensuremath∼25% at z ensuremath∼ 1. The satellite contribution to the total stellar mass budget in halos becomes more important than that of the central at halo masses of about M$_h$ \u003e 10$^13$ M$_ensuremathødot$ and always stays below the peak, indicating that quenching mechanisms are present in massive halos that keep the star- formation efficiency low. Finally, we compared our results with three hydrodynamical simulations: HORIZON-AGN, TNG100 of the ILLUSTRISTNG project, and EAGLE. We find that the most significant discrepancy is at the high-mass end, where the simulations generally show that satellites have a higher contribution to the total stellar mass budget than the observations. This, together with the finding that the fraction of satellites is higher in the simulations, indicates that the feedback mechanisms acting in both group- and cluster-scale halos appear to be less efficient in quenching the mass assembly of satellites - and that quenching occurs much later in the simulations.","tags":["\"galaxies: halos\"","\"galaxies: evolution\"","\"large-scale structure of Universe\"","\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\""],"title":"COSMOS2020: Cosmic evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation for central and satellite galaxies up to z ensuremath∼ 5","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erica J.

Here we present the most extreme of these systems: CEERS-1749. Based on $0.6-5μ$m photometry, this strikingly luminous ($≈$26 mag) galaxy appears to lie at $z≈17$. This would make it an $M_m̊UV≈-22$, $M_̊⋆≈5times10^9M_rø̊dot$ system that formed a mere $∼220$ Myrs after the Big Bang. The implied number density of this galaxy and its analogues challenges virtually every early galaxy evolution model that assumes $Łambda$CDM cosmology. However, there is strong environmental evidence supporting a secondary redshift solution of $z≈5$: all three of the galaxy's nearest neighbors at $\u003c2.5$'' have photometric redshifts of $z≈5$. Further, we show that CEERS-1749 may lie in a $z≈5$ protocluster that is $rsim5times$ overdense compared to the field. Intense line emission at $z≈5$ from a quiescent galaxy harboring ionized gas, or from a dusty starburst, may provide satisfactory explanations for CEERS-1749's photometry. The emission lines at $z≈5$ conspire to boost the $\u003e2μ$m photometry, producing an apparent blue slope as well as a strong break in the SED. Such a perfectly disguised contaminant is possible only in a narrow redshift window ($Δ złesssim0.1$), implying that the permitted volume for such interlopers may not be a major concern for $z\u003e10$ searches, particularly when medium-bands are deployed. If CEERS-1749 is confirmed to lie at $z≈5$, it will be the highest-redshift quiescent galaxy, or one of the lowest mass dusty galaxies of the early Universe detected to- date. Both redshift solutions of this intriguing galaxy hold the potential to challenge existing models of early galaxy evolution, making spectroscopic follow-up of this source critical.","tags":["\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\""],"title":"Schrodinger's Galaxy Candidate: Puzzlingly Luminous at $z≈17$, or Dusty/Quenched at $z≈5$?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vasily Kokorev","Gabriel Brammer","Seiji Fujimoto","Kotaro Kohno","Georgios E.

Additionally we have reconstructed the $textitSpitzer$ IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 $μ$m mosaics, by utilising all the available archival IRSA/SHA exposures.

IFU spectroscopy provides significant insight into the structure and mass content of galaxy clusters, yet IFU-based cluster studies focus almost exclusively on the central Einstein-radius region. Covering over 14 arcmin$^2$, the new MUSE mosaic extends significantly beyond the A370 Einstein radius, providing, for the first time, a detailed look at the cluster outskirts. Combining these data with wide-field, multi-band Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging from the BUFFALO project, we analyse the distribution of objects within the cluster and along the line of sight. Identifying 416 cluster galaxies, we use kinematics to trace the radial mass profile of the halo, providing a mass estimate independent from the lens model. We also measure radially averaged properties of the cluster members, tracking their evolution as a function of infall. Thanks to the high spatial resolution of our data, we identify six cluster members acting as galaxy-galaxy lenses, which constrain localized mass distributions beyond the Einstein radius. Finally, taking advantage of MUSE's 3D capabilities, we detect and analyse multiple spatially extended overdensities outside of the cluster that influence lensing-derived halo mass estimates. We stress that much of this work is only possible thanks to the robust, extended IFU coverage, highlighting its importance even in less optically dense cluster regions. Overall, this work showcases the power of combining HST + MUSE, and serves as the initial step towards a larger and wider program targeting several clusters.","tags":["\"gravitational lensing: strong\"","\"techniques: imaging spectroscopy\"","\"galaxies: clusters: individual: Abell 370\"","\"galaxies: kinematics and dynamics\"","\"dark matter\"","\"large-scale structure of Universe\"","\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\"","\"Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics\""],"title":"Pilot-WINGS: An extended MUSE view of the structure of Abell 370","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rohan P.

Here we present a search for luminous $z\u003e10$ galaxies with $JWST$/NIRCam photometry spanning $≈1-5μ$m and covering 49 arcmin$^2$ from the public $JWST$ Early Release Science programs (CEERS and GLASS). Our most secure candidates are two $M_m̊UV≈-21$ systems: GLASS-z13 and GLASS-z11. These galaxies display abrupt $rsim2.5$ mag breaks in their spectral energy distributions, consistent with complete absorption of flux bluewards of Lyman-$α$ that is redshifted to $z≈13$ and $z≈11$. Lower redshift interlopers such as dusty quiescent galaxies with strong Balmer breaks would be comfortably detected at $\u003e5σ$ in multiple bands where instead we find no flux. From SED modeling we infer that these galaxies have already built up $∼ 10^9$ solar masses in stars over the $łesssim300-400$ Myrs after the Big Bang. The brightness of these sources enable morphological constraints. Tantalizingly, GLASS-z11 shows a clearly extended exponential light profile, potentially consistent with a disk galaxy of $r_̊50≈0.7$ kpc. These sources, if confirmed, join GNz11 in defying number density forecasts for luminous galaxies based on Schechter UV luminosity functions, which require a survey area $\u003e10times$ larger than we have studied here to find such luminous sources at such high redshifts. They extend evidence from lower redshifts for little or no evolution in the bright end of the UV luminosity function into the cosmic dawn epoch, with implications for just how early these galaxies began forming. This, in turn, suggests that future deep $JWST$ observations may identify relatively bright galaxies to much earlier epochs than might have been anticipated.","tags":["\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\""],"title":"Two Remarkably Luminous Galaxy Candidates at $z≈11-13$ Revealed by JWST","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

However, due to the very limited photometry for individual galaxies, the true nature of these so-called HST-dark galaxies has remained elusive. Here, we present the first sample of such galaxies observed with very deep, high-resolution NIRCam imaging from the Early Release Science Program CEERS. 33 HST- dark sources are selected based on their red colours across 1.6 $μ$m to 4.4 $μ$m. Their physical properties are derived from 12-band multi-wavelength photometry, including ancillary HST imaging. We find that these galaxies are generally heavily dust- obscured ($A_V∼2$ mag), massive ($łog (M/M_ødot) ∼10$), star-forming sources at $z∼2-8$ with an observed surface density of $∼0.8$ arcmin$^-2$. This suggests that an important fraction of massive galaxies may have been missing from our cosmic census at $z\u003e3$ all the way into the reionization epoch.

Protoclusters, the overdense regions of the universe that ultimately collapse into massive galaxy clusters, contribute a significant fraction of all cosmic star formation during the era of reionization. The galaxy overdensity may enhance the escape of ionizing photons, making protoclusters crucial in driving the timing and topology of cosmic reionization. We propose to measure the brightest rest-frame-optical emission lines from spectrosopically-confirmed galaxies comprising the largest overdensity yet identified near the midpoint of cosmic reionization, z7OD.

In this work, we assess the degree of contamination by intermediate-redshift galaxies (z=1-5.8) expected for z\u003e6 galaxies within the Euclid Deep Survey. This study is based on i̊sebox-0.5ex~176,000 real galaxies at z=1-8 in a rs̊ebox-0.5ex~0.7 deg2 area selected from the UltraVISTA ultra-deep survey, and rae̊box-0.5ex~96,000 mock galaxies with 25.3$łeq$H\u003c27.0, which altogether cover the range of magnitudes to be probed in the Euclid Deep Survey. We simulate Euclid and ancillary photometry from the fiducial, 28-band photometry, and fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to various combinations of these simulated data. Our study demonstrates that identifying z\u003e6 with Euclid data alone will be very effective, with a z\u003e6 recovery of 91(88)% for bright (faint) galaxies. For the UltraVISTA-like bright sample, the percentage of z=1-5.8 contaminants amongst apparent z\u003e6 galaxies as observed with Euclid alone is 18%, which is reduced to 4(13)% by including ultra-deep Rubin (Spitzer) photometry. Conversely, for the faint mock sample, the contamination fraction with Euclid alone is considerably higher at 39%, and minimized to 7% when including ultra-deep Rubin data. For UltraVISTA-like bright galaxies, we find that Euclid (I-Y)\u003e2.8 and (Y-J)\u003c1.4 colour criteria can separate contaminants from true z\u003e6 galaxies, although these are applicable to only 54% of the contaminants, as many have unconstrained (I-Y) colours. In the most optimistic scenario, these cuts reduce the contamination fraction to 1% whilst preserving 81% of the fiducial z\u003e6 sample.

The resulting mosaics cover a total of approximately 71.5 deg$^2$ in the 3.6 and 4.5 ensuremathμm bands, and approximately 21.8 deg$^2$ in the 5.8 and 8 ensuremathμm bands. They reach at least 24 AB magnitude (measured to 5ensuremathσ, in a 2″.5 aperture) in the 3.6 ensuremathμm band and up to ensuremath∼5 mag deeper in the deepest regions. The astrometry is tied to the Gaia astrometric reference system, and the typical astrometric uncertainty for sources with 16 \u003c [3.6]\u003c 19 is ensuremathłesssim0″.15. The photometric calibration is in excellent agreement with previous WISE measurements. We extracted source number counts from the 3.6 ensuremathμm band mosaics, and they are in excellent agreement with previous measurements. Given that the Spitzer Space Telescope has now been decommissioned, these mosaics are likely to be the definitive reduction of these IRAC data.

Since the last public catalog in 2015, a wealth of new imaging and spectroscopic data has been collected in the COSMOS field. This paper describes the collection, processing, and analysis of this new imaging data to produce a new reference photometric redshift catalog. Source detection and multi-wavelength photometry is performed for 1.7 million sources across the 2deg2 of the COSMOS field, ∼966,000 of which are measured with all available broad-band data using both traditional aperture photometric methods and a new profile-fitting photometric extraction tool, The Farmer, which we have developed. A detailed comparison of the two resulting photometric catalogs is presented. Photometric redshifts are computed for all sources in each catalog utilizing two independent photometric redshift codes. Finally, a comparison is made between the performance of the photometric methodologies and of the redshift codes to demonstrate an exceptional degree of self-consistency in the resulting photometric redshifts. The i\u0026lt;21 sources have sub-percent photometric redshift accuracy and even the faintest sources at 25\u0026lt;i\u0026lt;27 reach a precision of 5%. Finally, these results are discussed in the context of previous, current, and future surveys in the COSMOS field. Compared to COSMOS2015, reaches the same photometric redshift precision at almost one magnitude deeper. Both photometric catalogs and their photometric redshift solutions and physical parameters will be made available through the usual astronomical archive systems (ESO Phase 3, IPAC IRSA, and CDS).\n","date":1642032e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642032e3,"objectID":"f1c5b34113972ec7b8d2d40c5fc2cf9a","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/post/c2020_accepted/","publishdate":"2022-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/c2020_accepted/","section":"post","summary":"Catalogs and data products are now available - [https://cosmos2020.calet.org/](https://cosmos2020.calet.org/)","tags":["Academic"],"title":"The COSMOS2020 Catalog has been published in ApJS!","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Keck/MOSFIRE | 2N | PI - C.

We aim (1) to spectroscopically confirm the emergence of the first quiescent galaxies when the Universe was only 1.2 Gyr old, and (2) to fully capture the Balmer break in the K-band to measure their star formation epoch and timescale, which will, combined with state-of-the-art simulations, give us new insights into key physics of very early quenching.\n","date":1641986112,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641986112,"objectID":"55a2dfacc5a22fd4a880674596bd87b9","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2022_subaru_tanaka/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/observation/2022_subaru_tanaka/","section":"observation","summary":"Keck/MOSFIRE | 2N | PI - M.

Since the last public catalog in 2015, a wealth of new imaging and spectroscopic data have been collected in the COSMOS field.

Source detection and multiwavelength photometry are performed for 1.7 million sources across the 2 deg$^2$ of the COSMOS field, åisebox-0.5ex~966,000 of which are measured with all available broadband data using both traditional aperture photometric methods and a new profile-fitting photometric extraction tool, THE FARMER, which we have developed. A detailed comparison of the two resulting photometric catalogs is presented. Photometric redshifts are computed for all sources in each catalog utilizing two independent photometric redshift codes. Finally, a comparison is made between the performance of the photometric methodologies and of the redshift codes to demonstrate an exceptional degree of self-consistency in the resulting photometric redshifts. The i \u003c 21 sources have subpercent photometric redshift accuracy and even the faintest sources at 25 \u003c i \u003c 27 reach a precision of 5%. Finally, these results are discussed in the context of previous, current, and future surveys in the COSMOS field. Compared to COSMOS2015, it reaches the same photometric redshift precision at almost one magnitude deeper. Both photometric catalogs and their photometric redshift solutions and physical parameters will be made available through the usual astronomical archive systems (ESO Phase 3, IPAC-IRSA, and CDS).","tags":["\"205\"","\"1671\"","\"594\"","\"734\"","\"1234\"","\"1145\"","\"1043\"","\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\"","\"Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics\""],"title":"COSMOS2020: A Panchromatic View of the Universe to z 10 from Two Complementary Catalogs","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Recent observations of the early universe have suggested the impossible: an abundance of ultra-massive, dead galaxies already within 1.5 billion years after the big bang.

Twelve of 13 detections above 5ensuremathσ are attributed to emission from galaxies, 11 of which are dominated by cold dust emission. These sources have a median redshift of $łangle z_2,mathrmmmångle =3.6_-0.3^+0.4$ primarily based on optical/near-infrared photometric redshifts with some spectroscopic redshifts, with 77% ensuremath± 11% of sources at z \u003e 3 and 38% ensuremath± 12% of sources at z \u003e 4.

The volume density of 2 mm selected DSFGs is consistent with predictions from some cosmological simulations and is similar to the volume density of their hypothesized descendants: massive, quiescent galaxies at z \u003e 2. Analysis of MORA sources' spectral energy distributions hint at steeper empirically measured dust emissivity indices than reported in typical literature studies, with $łangle β ral̊e =2.2_-0.4^+0.5$ . The MORA survey represents an important step in taking census of obscured star formation in the universe's first few billion years, but larger area 2 mm surveys are needed to more fully characterize this rare population and push to the detection of the universe's first dusty galaxies.","tags":["\"1061\"","\"1647\"","\"412\"","\"734\"","\"17\"","\"790\"","\"1570\"","\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\"","\"Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics\""],"title":"Mapping Obscuration to Reionization with ALMA (MORA): 2 mm Efficiently Selects the Highest-redshift Obscured Galaxies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vasily I.

We develop a novel panchromatic spectral energy distribution fitting algorithm, Stardust, that models the emission from stars, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and infrared dust emission, without relying on energy balance assumptions. Our code provides robust estimates of the UV- optical and FIR physical parameters, such as the stellar mass (M$_*$), dust mass (M$_dust$), infrared luminosities (L$_IR$) arising from AGN and star formation activity, and the average intensity of the interstellar radiation field (⟨U⟩). Through a set of simulations we quantify the completeness of our data in terms of M$_dust$, L$_IR$, and ⟨U⟩ and subsequently characterize the distribution and evolution of these parameters with redshift. We focus on the dust-to-stellar mass ratio (f$_dust$), which we parameterize as a function of cosmic age, stellar mass, and specific star formation rate. The f$_dust$ is found to increase by a factor of 10 from z = 0 to z = 2 and appears to remain flat at higher z, mirroring the evolution of the gas fraction. We also find a growing fraction of warm to cold dust with increasing distance from the main sequence, indicative of more intense interstellar radiation fields, higher star formation efficiencies, and more compact star-forming regions for starburst galaxies. Finally, we construct the dust mass functions (DMFs) of star-forming galaxies up to z = 1 by transforming the stellar mass function to DMF through the scaling relations derived here. The evolution of f$_dust$ and the recovered DMFs are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of the Horizon-AGN and IllustrisTNG simulations. * https://github.com/VasilyKokorev/stardust/","tags":["\"High-redshift galaxies\"","\"Submillimeter astronomy\"","\"Infrared astronomy\"","\"Astronomy software\"","\"Galaxies\"","\"Active galaxies\"","\"Starburst galaxies\"","\"734\"","\"1647\"","\"786\"","\"1855\"","\"573\"","\"17\"","\"1570\"","\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\""],"title":"The Evolving Interstellar Medium of Star-forming Galaxies, as Traced by Stardust","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Large galaxy surveys have revealed a surprising number of galaxies that have ceased (or quenched) their star-formation, seen as they were when the Universe was only half its current age.

They are interpreted as a population of galaxies which have recently undergone a major episode of star formation, and their study may elucidate the nature of galaxy bimodality. We employ a principal component analysis to study a sample of 32 low redshift (0.01 \u0026lt; z \u0026lt; 0.11) PSBs selected with SDSS DR 7 single-fibre spectroscopy and observed with MaNGA integral field spectroscopy. Morphologies are examined to characterise the sample, finding a mixture of starforming and quiescent parameters, indicative of tran- sition. We find that this rich sample exhibits strong radial gradients in stellar age, as measured by the principal components (PC) corresponding to the 4000-Å break strength and excess Hδ absorption. To examine the extent of aperture bias, we com- pare these two properties between the DR 7 and MaNGA spectra, integrated over 3\u0026quot; and the full aperture, finding evidence for systematics and radial gradients. We em- ploy two stellar population synthesis codes (BC03, FSPS) to test the manner in which star-formation proceeded, either as a single radially evolving burst, or coeval with varying burst strengths. Achieved here for the first time, we find a remarkable consistency between the models and gradients, suggesting complex and diverse star-formation histories. We show that this method, coupled with an increased sample size, is well-suited to elucidate the real nature of these strange and peculiar objects.\n","date":1625826888,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625826888,"objectID":"ead7406a6277bf3c2a7f8e3a136bb7c8","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/project/psb_manga/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T10:34:48.352Z","relpermalink":"/project/psb_manga/","section":"project","summary":"MPhys Thesis | We use SDSS-MaNGA integral field spectroscopy to investigate a sample of rare post-starbust galaxies","tags":["Galaxy Evolution"],"title":"Exploring the Origins of Galaxy Bimodality at z\u003c0.1","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625826888,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625826888,"objectID":"b16292266ed0b4c3bc0ffbc540a1f3bf","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/project/cosmos2020-smf/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T10:34:48.352Z","relpermalink":"/project/cosmos2020-smf/","section":"project","summary":"We construct and model the Stellar Mass and Mass Density Functions from the COSMOS2020 catalog","tags":["Galaxy Evolution","Featured"],"title":"Galaxy Stellar Mass Assembly History Over 13 Billion Years","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"PAPER: https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09691 NGC7252, which is one of the nearest major-merger galaxy remnants, is an ideal laboratory to study the processes inherent to the transformation of disc galaxies to ellipticals as observed about ~1Gyr after the collision. We obtained wide-field IFU spectroscopy with the VLT-VIMOS integral-field spectrograph covering the central 50\u0026quot;x50\u0026quot; of NGC7252 to map the stellar and ionised gas kinematics, and the distribution and conditions of the ionised gas, revealing the extent of ongoing star formation and recent star formation history. We find that the inner gas disc is not counter-rotating with respect to the stars and that the stellar kinematics appear complex with a clear indication of a prolate-like rotation component suggesting a polar merger configuration. The ongoing star formation rate is 2.2+-0.6 M_sun/yr and implies a typical depletion time of 2Gyr given the molecular gas content. Furthermore, the spatially-resolved star formation history suggests a slight radial dependence, moving outwards at later times. We confirm a large AGN-ionised gas cloud previously discovered 5kpc south of the nucleus, and find higher ionisation also at the galaxy centre relative to the surrounding gas disc. Although the higher ionisation towards the centre is potentially degenerate within the central star forming ring, it may be associated with a low-luminosity AGN. Although NGC7252 has been classified as post-starburst galaxy at the centre, the elliptical-like major-merger remnant still appears very active. A central kpc-scale gas disc has presumably re-formed quickly within the last 100Myr after final coalescence. The disc features ongoing star formation, implying Gyr long timescale to reach the red sequence through gas consumption alone. While NGC7252 is useful to probe the transformation from discs to ellipticals, it is not well-suited to study the transformation from blue to red at this point.\n","date":1625826888,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625826888,"objectID":"22544358b18324cd725f272769fe9a6b","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/project/ngc7252/","publishdate":"2021-07-09T10:34:48.352Z","relpermalink":"/project/ngc7252/","section":"project","summary":"We use ESO's VLT telescope to disect NGC 7252 with spatially resolved spectroscopy","tags":["Galaxy Evolution"],"title":"History and Destiny of a Major Merger Remnant","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Co-supervised Albert Sneppen, DAWN Summer Student (2015) In this project a neural network has been designed to classify stars and galaxies, where an optimal use of information and structure of the neural network has been investigated.

The starbursting dwarf irregular NGC 1427A presents an interesting case as it is being pulled into the nearby Fornax cluster at supersonic speeds, producing a visibly exceptional star formation rate and notably blue colors. It has been suggested that the highly deformed structure of NGC 1427A is due to ram pressure stripping as a result of interacting with a super-heated ICM provided by several nearby elliptical galaxies. The gas density profile of its leading edge is similar to a \u0026ldquo;bow-shock\u0026rdquo;, containing several dozen super-star clusters (SSCs) and thousands of smaller star forming clusters. It is clearly evident that the properties of NGC 1427A change rapidly over relatively short distances. Using dithered HST/ACS images in Sloan equivalent g\u0026rsquo; r\u0026rsquo; i\u0026rsquo; z\u0026rsquo; and Hα filters, we present a morphological and photometric study of NGC 1427A using a novel approach in which stellar properties are measured from sources grouped within localized regions. Apertures are fitted for ~5000 sources at 4σ using a filter-combined master image. Four characteristic regions are chosen to study stellar properties, selected interactively through DS9. We then introduce COMET, a specially-designed source catalog handler for producing graphical figures of each region, cropping both spatially and photometrically. These are then batch-reviewed and analyzed using synthetic isochrones corresponding of each region. Hα bright sources are indicated to illustrate the significance of SSCs. Secondary analysis is carried out using smoothed color maps of source-subtracted diffuse light, yielding penetrative mapping of underlying stellar populations. We show for the first time how the dynamical stellar populations of NGC 1427A differ as a function of position across the surface of the galaxy, ultimately furthering our understanding of cluster interactions and the evolution of irregular galaxies.

Now in the decade of groundbreaking optical-NIR facilities such as the Nancy Roman Space Telescope, alongside JWST, LSST, and Euclid, the stage is set to probe deeper into the Universe than ever before.

We study the spectral indices of post-processed mock IFS datacubes of binary merger simulations, carefully matched to the properties of the MaNGA IFS survey, with a variety of black hole (BH) feedback models, progenitor galaxies, orbits, and mass ratios. Based on our simulation sample, we find that only major mergers on prograde-prograde or retrograde-prograde orbits in combination with a mechanical BH feedback model can form galaxies with weak enough ongoing star formation, and therefore absent H ensuremathα emission, to be selected by traditional PSB selection methods. We find strong fluctuations in nebular emission line strengths, even within the PSB phase, suggesting that H ensuremathα selected PSBs are only a subsample of the underlying population. The global PSB population can be more robustly identified using stellar continuum-based approaches. The difficulty in reproducing the very young PSBs in simulations potentially indicates that new sub-resolution star formation recipes are required to properly model the process of star formation quenching. In our simulations, we find that the starburst peaks at the same time at all radii, but is stronger and more prolonged in the inner regions. This results in a strong time evolution in the radial gradients of the spectral indices that can be used to estimate the age of the starburst without reliance on detailed star formation histories from spectral synthesis models.","tags":["\"galaxies: evolution\"","\"galaxies: interactions\"","\"galaxies: star formation\"","\"galaxies: stellar content\"","\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\""],"title":"Comparison of stellar populations in simulated and real post-starburst galaxies in MaNGA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles L.

However, identifying large, but clean, samples of quiescent galaxies has proven difficult because of their near- degeneracy with interlopers such as dusty, star-forming galaxies. We describe a new technique for selecting quiescent galaxies based upon t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction. This t-SNE selection provides an improvement both over UVJ, removing interlopers that otherwise would pass color selection, and over photometric template fitting, more strongly toward high redshift. Due to the similarity between the colors of high- and low-redshift quiescent galaxies, under our assumptions, t-SNE outperforms template fitting in 63% of trials at redshifts where a large training sample already exists. It also may be able to select quiescent galaxies more efficiently at higher redshifts than the training sample.","tags":["\"Astronomy data analysis\"","\"Computational astronomy\"","\"Galaxy quenching\"","\"Quenched galaxies\"","\"Galaxy classification systems\"","\"Star formation\"","\"1858\"","\"293\"","\"2040\"","\"2016\"","\"582\"","\"1569\"","\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\"","\"Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics\""],"title":"A Method to Distinguish Quiescent and Dusty Star-forming Galaxies with Machine Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"ALMA | Cycle 7 | 10.7hrs | PI - K. Rowlands\nOne key problem in galaxy evolution is how and why galaxies stop forming stars. However, the exact mechanisms that lead to the disruption of the gas supply, the relative importance of different quenching mechanisms, and the timescales involved are still poorly understood. Post-starburst galaxies are an ideal laboratory to study the galaxy transition process as they have undergone a recent, rapid shutdown in star formation, and are expected to be devoid of cold gas. Surprisingly, many of these galaxies still host large reservoirs of molecular gas, which challenges our current picture of quenching. Recent studies of these galaxies suffered from an aperture bias - we know rapid quenching of star formation occured in some regions but we only have unresolved measurements of the molecular gas. We propose to map CO(1-0) emission at 2.5\u0026quot; resolution matched to optical integral field spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey in 13 post-starburst galaxies. We will determine whether a low gas fraction in post-starburst regions is the cause of quenching, or if gas is forming stars inefficiently. Only the combination of ALMA and optical IFU observations can reveal what processes are responsible for stopping star formation in galaxies.\n","date":1578827712,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578827712,"objectID":"af9ea49be58d1a092aa7726ceea1c98a","permalink":"https://astroweaver.github.io/observation/2020_alma_psb_rowlands/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/observation/2020_alma_psb_rowlands/","section":"observation","summary":"ALMA | Cycle 7 | 10.7hrs | PI - K.

The merging of galaxies is one key aspect in our favourite hierarchical ensuremathŁambdaCDM Universe and is an important channel leading to massive quiescent elliptical galaxies. Understanding this complex transformational process is ongoing.  Aims: We aim to study NGC 7252, which is one of the nearest major-merger galaxy remnants, observed 1 Gyr after the collision of presumably two gas-rich disc galaxies. It is therefore an ideal laboratory to study the processes inherent to the transformation of disc galaxies to ellipticals.  Methods: We obtained wide-field IFU spectroscopy with the VLT-VIMOS integral-field spectrograph covering the central 50`` × 50'' of NGC 7252 to map the stellar and ionised gas kinematics, and the distribution and conditions of the ionised gas, revealing the extent of ongoing star formation and recent star formation history.  Results: Contrary to previous studies, we find the inner gas disc not to be counter-rotating with respect to the stars. In addition, the stellar kinematics appear complex with a clear indication of a prolate-like rotation component which suggests a polar merger configuration. The ongoing star formation rate is 2.2 ensuremath± 0.6 M$_ensuremathødot$ yr$^-1$ and implies a typical depletion time of 2 Gyr given the molecular gas content. Furthermore, the spatially resolved star formation history suggests a slight radial dependence, moving outwards at later times. We confirm a large AGN-ionised gas cloud previously discovered 5 kpc south of the nucleus, and find a higher ionisation state of the ionised gas at the galaxy centre relative to the surrounding gas disc. Although the higher ionisation towards the centre is potentially degenerate within the central star forming ring, it may be associated with a low- luminosity AGN.  Conclusions: Although NGC 7252 has been classified as post-starburst galaxy at the centre, the elliptical-like major-merger remnant still appears very active. A central kpc-scale gas disc has presumably re-formed quickly within the last 100 Myr after final coalescence. The disc features ongoing star formation, implying Gyr long timescale to reach the red sequence through gas consumption alone. While NGC 7252 is useful to probe the transformation from discs to ellipticals, it is not well-suited to study the transformation from blue to red at this point.","tags":["\"galaxies: individual: NGC 7252\"","\"galaxies: elliptical and lenticular\"","\"cD\"","\"galaxies: formation\"","\"galaxies: interactions\"","\"Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies\""],"title":"History and destiny of an emerging early-type galaxy.
